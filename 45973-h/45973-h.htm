  <h2 id='ch01' class='c009'>CHAPTER I <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Perk Sighs for Action</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>San Diego, in sunny Southern California, was
looking its prettiest, with balmy breezes blowing
softly; cloudless blue skies overhead; the usual
throngs on the streets, and a general atmosphere
of contentment resting over the entire place.</p>

<p class='c011'>Already tourist pilgrims were beginning their
annual migration from the cold lands of the north
and northeast, seeking the more congenial climate
along the picturesque Coast, where flowers
bloomed throughout every month of the year; and
outdoor sports of all descriptions tempted those
inclined that way to participate.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, just the same, there appeared to be <i>one</i>
individual sauntering along Main Street, in a
certain San Diego suburb, who did not seem to
share in the general joyous spirit—this grumbler
amidst such perfect surroundings was really an
old friend of the reader, no other than Gabe
Perkiser, familiarly known among his fellows of
the flying fields by the shorter name of “Perk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At his side stalked his bosom pal, Jack Ralston,
in whose company latterly the said Perk had participated
in a number of thrilling flying stunts,
all of which have been narrated in the earlier
books of this series of aviation stories.</p>

<p class='c011'>Those who have enjoyed a previous recital of
their adventures in the precarious vocation they
followed, as policemen of the skies, need no further
introduction to the pair of cronies. For the
benefit of new readers, less fortunate, it may be
said right here, before embarking on the latest and
most thrilling of their recent exploits, that Jack
and Perk were trusted members of Uncle Sam’s
wide-flung Secret Service organization; and on
account of their clever and conscientious work,
often entrusted with some of the most dangerous
and difficult missions engaging the attention of the
high “muck-a-muck” (Perk’s definition) authorities
at Washington Headquarters.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What puts you in the dumps so, Perk?” Jack
was asking, after noticing for the tenth time what
a frown had settled on his chum’s usually smiling
phiz. “Dinner knocking harder than customary; or
did you get a letter from your best girl, breaking
off the engagement? Strikes me you’re fast becoming
a chronic crêpe-hanger these days.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s all hot air—boloney I’d call it, as yeou
know right well, Jack!” Perk flung back. “Chow
was all to the good—ain’t got nary a best gal, an’
never did have, neither—they’re all rank pizen
to me. Guess again, Mister.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then what <i>does</i> ail you, boy—something gone
wrong with your plans—can I do anything to
ease the strain? I’d go a long way to get you out
of that black look, partner; you’re worrying me a
heap I allow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The other stopped short on Main Street’s pavement,
and looked his companion straight in the
face, actually smiling a bit in the bargain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeou <i>would</i> do jest that, ole pal, wouldn’t
yeou? I know I’m a tarnel fool to get stewed like
this,” he burst out; “an’ orter be ashamed—I’m
meanin’ to kick outen it right away. Fact is, it’s
the same ole story, Jack—I’m gettin’ fed up by
things goin’ too smooth. Guess it’s in the blood—my
Yankee ancestors they was all men o’ action,
doers o’ things that called fur courage an’ double
risk. They set their seal on me, seems like; fur
ever since I was a kid I’ve been on the hunt fur
adventure by land an’ sea; yeah, an’ o’ late years,
in the air besides. That’s all I gotter say; but
blood’ll tell ev’ry time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” remarked Jack, looking much relieved
it could be seen. “I more than half suspected this,
Perk; but cheer up—the longest lane must have
its turning. Meanwhile we’re getting our regular
pay from our Uncle Samuel, remember!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But not earnin’ a red cent, jest the same, which
is what upsets me most,” continued the complaining
one. “Makes me feel like I’m sorter pensioned
off, an’ ain’t worth the snap o’ my fingers to the
Service. Huh!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nonsense, boy, that’s a silly way of looking at
things. We’re just resting up after that difficult
job we pulled off, with the help of the Mounted
Police, far away up in Northwest Canada.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> That
successful flight, and arrest, earned us a vacation,
our superiors believe; which I for one have enjoyed
immensely. Now I’m feeling fine, and fit for the
next commission the Big Boss decides to hand out
to us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hot-diggetty-dig! then I sure hopes it drifts
this way right quick,” Perk eagerly observed.
“I kinder guess them racketeers an’ their crowd
o’ bootleggers must a got things mighty near
sewed up, when the Department lets us loaf away
our time out here on the Gold Coast. If it keeps
on we’ll be apt to forget heow to handle a ship,
an’ get air shy—neow <i>wouldn’t</i> that same be a
tough joke on us poor guys?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Little danger of such a thing coming to pass,
Perk—it’s a whole bit like swimming—once you
learn how to keep afloat it’s good for a life-time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mebbe so, Jack—I got a hunch it’s the same
way with ridin’ a bike used to be—first few days
yeou felt stiff in all yeour joints, ev’rything out
o’ kelter; but when a chump got used to guidin’
the skittish wheel along it came as easy as fallin’
off a log. Honest Injun, neow, Jack, ain’t yeou
any idea when we’re apt to grab an order to get
goin’ again?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Any old day I’m looking for the same, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gosh! that don’t strike me as givin’ much encouragement,
partner,” Perk told his mate, aggrievedly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wrote in ten days ago,” Jack went on to say,
quietly, “to say our ship was in first-class condition,
while we were on deck, waiting for orders.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bully for yeou!” snapped Perk, brightening
up visibly, as though, like a war horse at the scent
of burnt powder making his nostrils quiver with
anticipation. “I’m right neow yearnin’ to set eyes
on a different landscape than sleepy ol’ San Diego,
an’ slow towns borderin’ on the same.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk only stated a truth when he referred to
his adventurous life. He was considerably older
than his running mate, having been over in France
when only eighteen years of age, handling a sausage
balloon on the fighting line, and running into
numerous close corners, having been shot down at
least twice.</p>

<p class='c011'>After the war was over he came home, and
started learning the ropes of the new craze—flying;
becoming a very good pilot in time, though a
bit reckless, it must be admitted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he drifted into the lumber camps, and
played logger for a few seasons. After that Perk,
who was proud of having a strain of Canadian
blood along with his Yankee heritage, turned up
among the Mounties in the Far Northwest regions
and spent some years doing service with
those dashing officers enforcing the Law of the
wilderness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meeting up with Jack Ralston—after being
coaxed to throw his fortunes in with the Secret
Service at Washington, he took a strong liking
for the bright-witted youngster, and they had been
boon comrades ever since, sharing their blankets,
meeting all manner of peril in company, and becoming
what might be called real “blood brothers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So, too, had Jack been through some interesting
experiences, although not of the same thrilling
character as those Perk could look back to, when
musing of the past.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had had a run of circus training, being a
natural athlete; and on the bills had been advertised
as a famous trapeze performer. Then naturally
the lure of the air gripped Jack, and forsaking
the sawdust ring he began making
parachute drops with one of those barnstorming
aviators possessing a dilapidated crate with which
he was wont to give exhibitions at Harvest Home
festivals, and County Fairs all over the West—just
as Lindbergh did in his school days.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was in this fashion that young Ralston learned
to be a clever pilot; and possibly his skill at the
controls was one leading factor bringing about an
earnest invitation for him to join up with the
Secret Service—about that time it became evident
that a new branch of the Law organization must
be built up, in order to compete with the lawless
smuggling gangs that were already using airplanes
with which to fetch contraband of every
description into the country.</p>

<p class='c011'>So well did the pair co-operate that they worked
as two parts of the whole machine—as one hand
knows what the other hand requires to make a
finished product so their brains often worked in
unison, thus adding additional strength to their
united efforts.</p>

<p class='c011'>As they continued their walk, meaning to return
to the city in time for lunch, Perk continued to
ramble on with observations covering much
ground; for he had a decided opinion on every
variety of subject, and could be depended on to
exploit his ideas at the slightest invitation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No use talkin,’ Jack,” he was saying, as he
tapped his pocket significantly, “that same Jerry
Slocum’s a crackin’ good locksmith an’ gunsmith.
I took up with his offer, yeou know, to put my ol’
six-shooter, used in France with my work in the
sausage balloon corps, in apple-pie condition; an’
he done a smart job. He happened to have some
ammunition to fit the gun, so I laid in a bunch o’
cartridges, meanin’ to shoot at a target when time
hung heavy on my hands. But listen, will yeou, ol’
pard, what’s all that whoopin’ mean ’round the
corner jest ahead—sounds like a reg’lar <i>stampede</i>
was takin’ place, I’d say if yeou asked me?”</p>

  <h2 id='ch02' class='c015'>CHAPTER II <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>He Gets His Wish</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Some excitement, I own up, Perk,” agreed
Jack, exchanging a look of inquiry with his companion.
“Dog fight, like as not, since I thought
I heard a yowling just then, as if one mutt’d got
his in the neck.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jest hear the people a shoutin’ will yeou?”
snapped Perk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But that doesn’t sound like they were enjoying
themselves a heap, I’d say, boy—such screaming
and yelling—they’re badly rattled over whatever’s
going on. What could it all mean, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hot-diggetty-dig! we’ll know right soon, ole
hoss; ’cause it’s headin’ this way—gettin’ a heap
louder ev’ry second, I vow! Guess yeou struck it
right when yeou sez they must be skeered into a
near panic. Don’t hear no guns agoin’ off, so it
cain’t be a brawl ’tween drunken bootleggers an’
town constables. Well, I swan, it gets me—look
at the folks a beatin’ it to the houses, like they
reckoned they’d be safer there. Mebbe we better
shin up a telegraph pole like that youngster’s a
doin’ over yonder—he means to git high an’ dry,
so’s to see the circus, but not take chances with the
runaway animal’s flyin’ heels. Wow! what’s this
I lamp a comin’ ’reound that corner, waggin’ his
ole head from side to side—a big yeller <i>dog</i>, Jack,
with foam a drippin’ from his open red mouth!
Great guns!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That beast is as mad as a hatter!” boomed
Jack, thrilled by the frightful sight. “He’s bound
to own the whole street, no matter if a battalion of
cops try to sheer him off!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mebbe, mate,” Perk was shouting “we’d better
be steppin’ to one side in a hurry; I ain’t lost
nary dog; an’ I’m not fool enough to want to stand
up ’fore one that’s rabid—not Gabe Perkiser!
Get a move on, Jack, an’ vamose!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wait up!” cried the other, for so great was the
clamor no one could expect to be heard unless
he fairly shouted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Excuse me, boy—I got a date!” Perk bellowed
back, grinning as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look ahead, Perk—that child—little boy he
is—fell down in his fright, and must’ve sprained
his ankle—see him try to scramble up again; but
he can’t manage it, what with his fright and
twisted ankle. The dog—it’s making straight
for the youngster—we can’t stand by, and see
him tackle such a mere baby—we’ve just <i>got</i> to
do something, Perk!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure do, partner—let’s go!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Others were running in every direction save
toward the great ugly beast, thinking in their
panicky state of nerves only of their own safety.
All the while the shouts continued to go booming
along the length of Main Street:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mad dog! mad dog! everybody run—get the
children indoors! He’s rabid and ready to snap
at anybody in his way! Run for it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the poor little baby directly in the path of
the oncoming demon could not heed the shouts—vainly
he tried to crawl to one side, his terrified
eyes fixed on that dreadful vision of fury and
rabies confronting him, and drawing closer with
every passing second.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack and Perk were galloping forward with all
their might, intending to throw themselves between
the child and that stumbling terror with the
lolling head and dripping jaws.</p>

<p class='c011'>It could be seen that Perk was gripped by a
sudden inspiration—he had dragged some sort of
object from his pocket, and was working feverishly
with the same. Jack understood, and inwardly
blessed the lucky chance that had caused
his pal to fetch his old war weapon out to his friend
the town gunsmith, so as to have it put in first-class
condition. It must have been the hand of a
kind fate that brought about this wonderful coincidence,
Jack was telling himself, when guessing
that the running airman must be trying with all
his cleverness to insert a cartridge or two into the
chambers of the small, antiquated six-shooter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fortune favored them, for they were enabled to
pass beyond the writhing and shrieking child, thus
facing the danger themselves as a shield to buck
up against the charge of the mad dog.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk dropped down on one knee—it was the
natural position for one to assume under such
conditions, bringing him more on a level with
the beast. Jack, too, knew he had a part in the
scheme to save the tiny lad—lacking a weapon
of any kind he could not stand by Perk; but one
thing was left to him, which was to snatch up the
imperiled child, and leap to safety before the crisis
crashed upon them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even as he was thus bearing the lad out of the
danger zone, he caught a sudden explosion that
told him Perk had sent in a shot. It was his bosom
pal crouched back there with that shaggy beast
almost upon him; for he knew full well Perk had
waited until he could make doubly certain of his
aim.</p>

<p class='c011'>Somehow Jack could not keep from turning his
head, so as to know the worst—he had a cold
feeling in the region of his heart, undoubtedly
fearing he would discover Perk engaged in a
furious struggle at close quarters with the animal,
one bite from whose jaws would contaminate the
flesh his cruel fangs thus mangled.</p>

<p class='c011'>But that fear was instantly put to flight—Perk
still knelt there, while the furious beast writhed
on the ground, making frightful efforts to get up
on its four feet again.</p>

<p class='c011'>This he no sooner succeeded in doing than Perk
let him have a second leaden pill, working his keepsake
weapon of the great war with mechanical
precision. How lucky then he must have succeeded
in thrusting <i>two</i> cartridges into the maw of his
gun, since there proved to be such great need of an
<i>encore</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was “all over but the shouting,” as Perk
himself would have put it. He rose to his feet,
and coolly stepped forward, to bend over and
see that there no longer remained a single breath
in the carcase of the terrible brute he had stayed
in his mad passage through the town.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tenor of the wild shouts changed like magic—joy
and triumph, not to say relief, began to
be heard, as if reassuring the frightened populace
there was no longer anything to be feared—the
ogre Jabberwock had been laid low, and once again
the length of Main Street could be traversed without
peril to life and limb.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the one who had performed this valorous
deed seemed only anxious to make himself scarce
before the worshiping citizens could lay hands
on him—shower him with thanks, perhaps <i>kisses</i>
as well from the gentler sex, who knew a hero in
the flesh as well as on the Hollywood screen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack was trying the best he knew how to allay
the terror of the child he still held in his arms,
speaking to him with assurance in his tones, and
squeezing the white-faced little chap close to his
heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s all right, buddy,” he kept saying, with
a comforting smile on his face, that was bound to
stop the trembling sobs of the other, if anything
could. “The ugly dog can’t hurt you, for he’s been
killed, and can never bite anybody. You must have
hurt your ankle, little brother; I’m going to carry
you to where you live, so they can take care of
you, and get the kind doctor to take the pain away.
Put your arms around my neck, and I’ll be able
to hold you better—that’s the way, kiddie; you
know I’m a good friend of yours, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The crowd was all around them by this time,
milling so as to get as close as possible—it reminded
Jack of cattle being rounded up by expert
punchers, so as to be shipped to market, or it might
be, branded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stand back, please, and give us air!” Jack called
out, to add: “Perk, see that they don’t crowd in
any further. I’m not going to be satisfied until
I’ve seen this little lad safe in his home. Who
knows where he lives?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There were a dozen voices raised in explanations;
but Jack lifted a hand to stop the confused
racket.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hold up on that!” he told them, sharply; “I
want just one person to tell me—here, you boy,
you seem to know him okay—tell me his name, will
you, and where he lives—nobody else break in
now, get that? Go on, George, speak up!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My name’s Jimmy—his’n is Laddy Boy—he
lives with his granny Mrs. Fergussan right ’round
that next corner, in a little shack.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fine for you Jimmy—lead us to it; and please
everybody stop pushing—that shouting must be
dropped, or you’ll have the old lady frightened
half to death before we get there. Now start along,
Jimmy—you’re a good pal to tie to, I’ll say.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So they made a start, with scores following
after them, all talking; but in more subdued tones.
Possibly they realized that this young chap with
the capable look, and firm voice, was one accustomed
to having his orders obeyed without any
questions being asked, and that he would brook no
interference.</p>

<p class='c011'>As they turned into the side street the young
pilot hastened to point in the direction of a small
old, but respectable looking cottage of some three
rooms, that was surrounded by masses of flowers
in full bloom.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack could see the door of the small house was
wide open, and that an elderly woman stood there,
shading her eyes with a hand, as she watched the
approach of the crowd. Undoubtedly she must
have heard what had been so loudly shouted, when
the mad dog was causing such a panic on Main
Street—she may even have started toward the
nearby corner, with a great fear tugging at her
heart, knowing her Laddie Boy was going about
on the little errand she had entrusted to him; but
if so fear had driven her back to the home, where
she could slam the door shut in case personal
peril threatened her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Seeing Jack in the lead of the procession, carrying
some object in his arms, she came flying down
to meet him, looking aghast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t be so alarmed Mrs. Ferguson,” Jack
said, sympathizing with her new fears; “he wasn’t
bitten by the dog; but had the bad luck to sprain
his ankle. It’s nothing serious, I’m telling you
straight—lead the way, and I’ll put him on a
bed, when you can send for the doctor to look
him over; but don’t worry—he’s safe enough, I
promise you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently Jack joined his partner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let’s go, matey,” Perk hastened to say, uneasily,
as though he feared those admiring good
folks outside were actually conspiring to pick him
up on their shoulders, and march around town
with the hero of the mad dog scare; something
like that, but to which he was very must averse.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wait a few minutes,” Jack told his nervous
comrade, “I promised the old lady I’d stay out
here until the doctor had looked the child over;
she wants to get the story out of us, I imagine,
guessing something queer must have happened,
from the way those folks kept pawing at us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk drew a long breath, and muttered something
under his breath that sounded like “drat the
tough luck;” but he did settle down on a chair,
and amused himself looking around the room, on
the walls of which were a number of cheap pictures,
also several portraits.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come over here, Perk,” Jack was saying, as
he stood in front of the picture of a man, “here’s
a queer happening—look at that face—have you
ever seen it before?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c015'>CHAPTER III <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Echoes of the Past</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Looking rather surprised, as well as duly curious
after his nature, Perk accordingly stepped
blithely up, took one good stare, and immediately
burst out with his characteristic and pet “swear-word”
phrase:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hot-diggetty-dig! hard to b’lieve my eyes, for
a fact, partner—course I seen that phiz afore
neow, an’ same stirs up some mighty warm session
we passed through a while back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you say it’s a portrait of Slim Garrabrant?”
asked Jack, in a lower key, and with a
quick glance toward the connecting door that
was a bit ajar it happened.</p>

<p class='c011'>“None other, buddy—the slickest flim-flam artist
that ever fooled the banks of every state west
o’ the Mississip—fair good job that crayon artist
made o’ his work—mebbe copied from a reg’lar
photo. Ain’t this this the limit though—to think o’
runnin’ acrost <i>his</i> mug out here clost to San Diego.
Huh! I allers heard the world seemed mighty small
sometimes, an neow I b’lieves it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack put a finger up to his lips warningly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Softly, Perk. That old lady must be some close
connection of Slim’s, I’d say; it may be his own
mother—yes, the fact of finding his picture hanging
on this wall in an honored place makes that
plain; she evidently doesn’t know what a rogue her
boy is—they must have kept things from reaching
her ears after we gobbled him up, and he was sent
to Leavenworth—or was it Atlanta?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeou got me there, ’cause I never did know,”
observed Perk, taking yet another look at the face
within the gold frame. “Aint sech a tough looker
as we know he is, eh, ole pal?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that’s a fact; but then this was evidently
taken years ago, most likely, before he became so
hardened. I wonder—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What neow, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That handsome little boy must be some relative
of Slim’s,” said Jack, on a hazard; “if he was old
enough I’d begin to believe the kid was his own
child—they call her Grandmammy Ferguson, remember—yes,
that would square things I’d reckon,
Perk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aint it won-der-ful?” the other was saying,
half to himself apparently; “jest to think o’ us
arunnin’ smack into somebody connected with the
man we was responsible for sendin’ to the pen
years ago. ’Bout one chanct in a million sech a
thing could happen; but it shore has.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack also showed that he was feeling about the
same as his comrade; indeed it was one of the
queerest episodes he had ever met up with.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If that turns out to be a fact,” he went on to
comment, “I imagine Garrabarnt behind the bars
would give considerable for a glimpse of that kid’s
sweet face.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wouldn’t blame him any at that, Jack. How
’bout the kid—dye kinder guess he’ll have a bad
time with that leg?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The doctor will be able to say after he’s had
a lookover,” came the confident answer. “My opinion
is it’ll prove to be a simple sprain, and if such
is the case the child will only have to keep quiet
for a spell. There’s a car stopping at the gate, and
the man getting out has the look of a professional—yes,
he’s carrying a little satchel in the bargain,
so it must be the doctor she sent after.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This proved to be the case, for the young man
spoke to them on entering, and seemed very agreeable.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s happened here?” he asked, as though
his hasty summons, and the sight of that excited
crowd outside, had aroused his curiosity greatly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack thought the doctor should be told what
necessity there was for his services; as such knowledge
would prepare him for what must follow.
Accordingly he very briefly explained, making
light of what connection he and Perk had with the
matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus forewarned the doctor smiled his thanks,
and hastened to pass into the room where the old
lady and the child were located. Some little time
afterwards the doctor came out again. Perk could
see from the look on his face it was not so very
serious, nor was he mistaken in his diagnosis.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A simple sprain, just as you suspected,” the
physician assured them; “and he’ll be running
around again inside of five days.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He shook hands with them very earnestly, which
fact caused Perk to remark, after the doctor had
passed out of the door:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! it’s mighty plain to be seen, Jack, he’s
smart enough to smell a rat—the grip he gimme
said as he kinder guessed <i>we</i> had a finger in the
pie. Look for yeourself, partner—he’s talkin’ to
some o’ the folks out there, an’ I jest bet yeou
they’re a makin’ out we done somethin’ grand.
Rats! why caint a gink do a simple thing like we
done without people wantin’ to gush over him?
Makes me fair sick to see so much o’ the stuff
wasted. Do we get a move on right away, mate?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Better wait up a bit until he starts back to his
office,” suggested Jack, also peeping out of the
window.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeou said it, Jack—if we stepped eout right
neow it’d look like we wanted ’em to give us a
cheer—as for me I’d be glad if we could slip away
by the back door, an’ give ’em the laugh. There,
he’s gettin’ into his car, an’ the coast’s clear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack stepped into the other room to say goodbye
to the old lady—for she did seem to be of a higher
class than one would think from the humble cottage
she called home—truth to tell Jack wished to
have another look at that bright-faced little lad,
whom he was apt to remember for a long time.</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy had come-to, and shook hands at Jack’s
request, also gave him a sweet smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If he owes either of us any thanks,” Jack told
Granny, as he turned to leave, “it should go to my
chum; who chanced to have a gun in his pocket,
having had it cleaned and repaired at a shop here—he
threw himself between the ugly dog and the
child, and shot the mad brute dead. The lad wasn’t
touched, I assure you, madam.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank him for me a thousand times, please,
young man—it was a brave act, and his mother
surely has cause to be grateful for having such a
son. Come and see us sometime later on; both of us
will be very glad to have you drop in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack hurried out, with a strange thought racing
through his brain; he could not help wondering
what that fine elderly woman would think if only
she knew how the two young men thus befriending
her grandson (who must have been so precious
to her heart) had been the chief instrument
in shape of the outraged Law to run down and
send her son-in-law Slim Garrabarnt, up to the
penitentiary for a long term of years, as a much
wanted criminal.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was hardly a pleasant thought, but nothing
to be ashamed of, since he merely represented the
Government in all he had done, and could not be
blamed any more than the judge who dealt out the
grim sentence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk was eager to be gone, and led the way
outside. They pushed a passage through the still
jabbering crowd, and walked off, followed by admiring
looks from those gathered there.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the way back to the city Perk seemed to
be wrapped in his own thoughts much of the time,
which was such an unusual occurrence that Jack
marveled to take note of his silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Still o’ the opinion the kid might be his’n?”
Perk asked his companion, as they finally drew
near the location of the building in which they had
a furnished room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Feel pretty sure of it,” he was told, without
the slightest hesitation. “I explained to the old
lady that it was you who kept the dog from contact
with the child, and she asked me to thank you
with all her heart.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shucks! why did yeou ever mention sech a
thing, Pal Jack? ’Twan’t nawthin’ ’tall—jest a
soft snap for a chap what was yearnin’ for action.
But it gives me a queer thrill to know heow we
run up agin <i>his</i> folks—’bout a hundred-an’-thirty
million people in this here country, an’ to think
we’d pick ’em aout o’ all that mob—it sure has got
me buffaloed for keeps.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As Jack opened the locked door of their room
he stooped to pick up some object that had been
thrust underneath. Perk saw it was a letter, with
a special delivery stamp on the same. Somehow its
coming gave him a sudden thrill around the region
of his heart, as though he could sense important
news in the offing—apparently this was destined
to be a red-letter day in their experiences, with
a decided break in the long release from active
duty.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c015'>CHAPTER IV <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>By Special Delivery</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Somewhat to the disappointment of Perk his
comrade did not evince any haste about opening
his letter, thrusting the same into his pocket, while
he washed his hands, and brushed his hair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Somehow I seem to be as hungry as a wolf,”
Jack remarked; “and as it’s long past our usual
time for lunch I move we drop around to our
beanery, and lay in some stores in the way of
chow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course such a proposition appealed strongly
to Perk, who was seldom able to resist a call to
meals. For the moment he quite forgot his recent
curiosity to know what was in the letter, the
receipt of which had caused Jack to smile; and
which moreover had certain familiar marks about
it to make Perk feel certain it came from Headquarters.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Queer heow a feller c’n nigh ’bout forget
certain stirrin’ events in his past,” he observed
with a shake of his head; “an’ suddenly have the
same bob up in his mind, as clear as if they might a
happened on’y yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I reckon you’re referring to our old friend,
Cool Slim Garrabrant, eh, Perk?” queried the
other, indifferently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“None other,” came the reply. “There was a
man as might be called the king o’ the counterfeiters,
who’d had his thumb to his nose ever so
long, alaughin’ at Uncle Sam’s slick boys, an’
sendin’ ’em all sorts o’ tauntin’ notes; so in the
end the Chief he come down off’n his high perch,
an’ gave <i>us</i> a chanct to knock down the persimmons
with a long pole; which we done as neat as
any body’d choose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bad taste to boast, Perk, you want to remember.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can’t help sayin’ a few things, Jack, an’ pattin’
us two flyin’ cops on the chest. Honest, I got an
idea Slim’s sun had begun to set jest as soon as
the job o’ runnin’ him in was placed in aour hands.
Nobody but them as knew haow to handle an airship
could a fetched home the bacon in that case;
’cause Slim he knowed how to get his long-green
stuff clear withaout leavin’ any trace, usin’ that ole
crate to carry the coney supplies east an’ west o’
his hidin’ place, where he carried on the work
along a big scale.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course what you say is all true enough,”
ventured Jack as they walked along, heading for
the nearest eatingplace, which they sometimes patronized
when close by; “but both of us would do
well to try and forget our share in that haul—it’s
old stuff by now. And besides,” continued Jack,
“somehow I feel bad when I remember that it was
probably that little kid’s own daddy we sent up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeah!” mused Perk, unwilling to change the
subject, it appeared, “an’ the judge socked it to
Slim good an’ heavy—give him a long sentence,
so ’at he’ll have to serve behind the walls o’ that
Atlanta pen ’til he’s an old, broken-down man,
an’ not marked dangerous to law-abidin’ folks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are a few others of his stripe yet outside
prison walls, remember, partner,” Jack told him,
as they entered the eatingplace, walking over to
a table somewhat aloof from all others, and on
this account usually chosen for such meals as they
took there; as they sometimes discussed their secret
work while eating it was policy to keep clear
from other diners, and at the same time lower
their voices, since walls may have ears, and
even hide dictaphones that record every spoken
word.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeou never said truer words, ole top,” Perk
agreed in his odd fashion. “Scofflaws aplenty to
keep our crowd busy for years ahead. Say, d’ye
know I been readin’ a heap ’bout a smart guy
they say calls hisself King Cole—seems like he
got a hole in the wall ’way out in the wildest part
o’ the Rockies, an’ jest laughs at the boys from
Washington to size him up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I recollect you talking of him more than a few
times, Perk; from which fact I had a hunch you
might be wishing the Chief’d turn over the assignment
for apprehending him to our hands—is
that correct, partner?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t care if I do have to acknowledge the
corn, matey; someheow that dickey grabbed a
stiff hold on my thinkin’ box—why, onct I even
dreamed we’d cornered him with his gay crowd,
an’ was commencin’ to exchange shots with the
bunch, when I woke up, an’ felt too cheap for anything
to know it was on’y hot air.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack laughed as he seated himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I remember how furious you were, and saying
it was a shame to be cheated that way, eh,
Perk?”</p>

<p class='c011'>They gave their orders, and were presently
partaking of what the waiter set before them;
afterwards retiring, as though already knowing
they would call should they require further service.
This afforded Perk another opportunity to “use
his tongue,” a vocation that gave him the utmost
enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jest occurred to me them paper accounts sez as
haow his bees’-nest was located in a stretch ’tween
two o’ the highest mountain ranges in the hull
country o’ the Rockies—called the secret settlement
Happy Valley; which I opine sounds a right
queer name for a den o’ pizenous human snakes,
sech as the Law wants f’r ’bout ev’ry crime on the
calendar.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No accounting for tastes, buddy,” Jack told
him. “It might feel that way to men against whom
the hand of every honest person was raised. Most
of his crowd, I read, was believed to be reckoned
the scum of the earth, who were wanted for nearly
every crime going—murderers, bank cashiers
who’d robbed the institutions of which they had
been the head; and all such black sheep, outlawed
from decent society by their crimes and misdemeanors.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk grinned amiably, as though what his companion
had just said made no difference to him—that
he still wished from the bottom of his heart
they were commissioned to undertake the dangerous
task of breaking up the settlement in that
so-called Paradise of fugitives.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t faize me any when yeou talk that way,
boy,” he told his companion, with one of his
amused chuckles that seemed to come up from his
toes, “The more stuff yeou gotter bump up agin
the better I like it—cain’t be too tough for a hill-billy
like me—that’s what they calls the boys
daown in the Ozarks, where I put in near a hull
year huntin’ precious stones in the earth, an’ never
findin’ enuff to git me my grub. Another o’ them
memories as comes along withaout warnin’, to
ha’nt me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perk, you promised me once that some fine day
you’d make a start at that memory book, covering
all your activities since you were knee-high to a
duck—I’m going to press you to really start in
doing the job, Perk; it will make a book well
worth reading, if only half of all the adventures
you’ve told me about are included. Now, don’t
forget your promise, for I’ll hold you to it the
next layoff we have float our way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I sure hate to do it, partner; but seein’ I did
give yeou my solemn word I s’pose I’ll jest have to
keep my promise; but it’ll seem to me like a heap
o’ blarney an’ boastin’. My loose tongue sure gets
me into a nest o’ scrapes, which ain’t one bit pleasin’
to sech a shy gink as me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ah! Perk’s eyes opened wider as he saw the
other make a quick movement with his hand, as
though suddenly remembering the mysterious
letter thrust under the door of their room, and
bearing that long blue stamp that signified special
service, quick delivery to the person addressed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sure enough Jack drew the missive out, and
proceeded to cut the end of the envelope, using
a table knife for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c011'>Shooting a quick glance across the table in the
direction of his chum, he smiled slightly, as though
very well knowing how Perk was eating his heart
up with curiosity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk stopped feeding, as his abstraction was so
intense he hardly knew the way to his mouth—both
eyes were glued on Jack’s face, as if he hoped
to read the answer to the riddle there, a thing that
had never as yet come within the scope of his
knowledge, since Jack could hide his emotions under
an assumed indifference that baffled interpretation.</p>

<p class='c011'>It seemed that Jack had read every word of the
letter, although there were several enclosures yet
to be gone over; however he appeared as if he had
picked up certain intelligence of such a drastic
character as to make him sit there mulling it all
over, and possibly trying to dovetail things together.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk, poor fellow, could stand the awful suspense
no longer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, ole scout, ain’t yeou thinkin’ ’baout lettin’
me into the game—I somehaow take it fur granted
there’s news come ’long that’s agoin’ to start us off
agin follerin’ the air trails on the heels o’ some
skunks what got themselves outside the law. Lay
off, partner, an’ gimme a run fur my money, won’t
yeou?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c015'>CHAPTER V <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>The Cat is Out of the Bag</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Jack looked at Perk, and smiled.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I certainly must ask your pardon, old chap,”
he hastened to say; “for keeping you in the dark so
long. Fact is, what came to me in this letter gave
me such food for thought I clean forgot you were
my side partner, and entitled to my full confidence.
Forgive it, Perk, wont you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure thing, Jack; then I kinder guess the letter
must be from Headquarters?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No other, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s in the wind this time?” demanded the
other, eagerly; as though his nostrils could already
sniff the burnt powder that went with action.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s a fair question, and I’ll try to answer
you,” said Jack. “It isn’t the mere fact that we’re
ordered to duty once more, that I was thinking
about just now, because such a thing comes along
every once in so often in the exercise of our duties—but
strangely enough our meeting up to-day with
the family of a man we’d help put in jail doesn’t
seem to bring our queer list of coincidences to a
halt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hot-diggetty-dig! naow yeou got me a guessin’
good an’ hard, partner—go to it, an’ explain what
yeou mean.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, it looks as if a wish you expressed only
a short time ago was going to be fulfilled,” Jack
told him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Haow come, buddy?” queried Perk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We were talking about a certain scoundrel
who’s name we’ve seen so often of late in the
papers—remember, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c011'>An expression of sublime delight passed over
the face of Gabe Perkiser; showing how he understood,
and what a sense of exhileration the knowledge
afforded him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Kinder guess naow, Jack, yeou might be
meanin’ that same Ole King Cole like he goes to
call hisself—the brazen guy that makes all kinds
o’ fun o’ Secret Service mokes—is <i>that</i> the answer,
brother?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack nodded in a way that could have only one
meaning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Okay, Perk; you’re on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shake on that, young feller—it’s the most
glorious news I ever did get outen Washington.
If half what they says turns aout to be true,
we’re in fur the hot time o’ aour life, seems like.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You never can tell, partner, which way the
cat will jump—sometimes when you’re expecting
an easy windup things get mighty tough; then
again if you’re looking for a hard battle it sometimes
turns out to be just a mere walkover—a flash
in the pan. We have to take things as we find them,
and let it go at that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ole King Cole sent aout his nasty defi to the
hull Secret Service crowd, an’ so far he’s been able
to give the boys the nasty grand laugh; but they
say a pitcher may go to the well jest onct too many
times—mebbe we might be the lucky ones to smash
the same, pronto.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve read that two different men of our staff
have disappeared, after getting hot on the trail of
this band of scoundrels; which goes to tell us
they’re a hard-boiled bunch, who wont stop at
committing any crime so as to keep out of the pen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk only grinned, as though the tougher they
came the more he liked them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s all right Jack, I’m best suited when they
make ’em that way,” he hastened to assure his
chum; although really there was no need of his
thus doing, since Jack knew him like a book, with
all his good qualities, and shortcomings as well.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you through eating?” asked the other; and
on receiving an affirmative nod he continued: “all
right, suppose we adjourn to our room for a conference,
where we can be dead certain of not being
overheard. There are a few other things to tell
that may open your eyes still further, as they did
mine; besides, the Big Boss enclosed a few clippings,
and typed reports, for us to study, as he believes
they will give us some important clues that
are going to be of considerable help in tracking
these outlaws to their den.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gee whiz! things <i>do</i> seem to be headin’ aour
way, don’t they though, Jack? Yeou said there
might be a sudden turn in the game, an’ she sure
enough did come hoppin’ ’long, to make me laugh,
an’ feel so like singin’.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, please don’t start that racket here, partner;
if ever they heard you singing they’d certainly
put the bars against us; and we both like the chow
in this same little restaurant, remember.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go easy on a feller whose education in music
must a been neglected when he was a kid. An’
Jack, mebbe so yeou’ll let me set my lamps on that
ere document, onct we get indoors at aour
quarters.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’re going to know everything that I do,
Perk; that goes without question; for how could
we work together as a team if we pulled contrarywise?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Leaving the eatinghouse they were soon back
in their comfortable room, where they could take
things easy while laying out plans for the near
future.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk started his favorite pipe going, as though
getting ready to be vastly entertained by what was
in prospect; he always looked as though at peace
with the whole world, even counting those who
defied the law to keep them from doing whatever
they pleased, however it might turn out for other
people—such was the beneficial effects of tobacco
on his system, for there were times when he could
never be supremely happy until he got his pipe
going full blast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Naow fur it, partner;” he opened up with, “I’m
settled, an’ ready to imbibe the hull kittin’ story,
with nawthin’ bein’ held back, like yeou promised
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m meaning to read the letter to you first, and
then later on you can pore over it yourself, making
a mental photograph of the contents, so that every
sentence can be recalled from memory upon occasion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the way Jack generally arranged
things, for he knew just how to work so as to get
Perk fully interested; and accustomed to the programme
the other had never been known to take
exception to Jack’s methods.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I get yeou, partner,” was Perk’s comment; “it’s
part o’ aour reg’lar programme to learn the big
points o’ aour job, so we aint agoin’ to be rattled
when we come to settle daown to work.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now fix your mind on what I’m going to read,
and forget everything else but the one business
we’re being given to carry through.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Accordingly Jack commenced, with Perk occasionally
asking some pertinent question, which
was cheerfully answered by the reader.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now,” observed Jack later on, “we’ve covered
much that the Chief has had taken down by his
stenographer; but the windup of the whole matter
is the heart of the story; you want to hold your
breath while I read it out to you, because, unless
I miss my guess, you’re in for the biggest shock of
your life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hot-diggetty-dig! that sounds right ser’us,
partner, she shore do; but I’ll stiffen aout, grip the
sides o’ my chair, an’ gulp it all in like a thirsty
broncho would fresh water after comin’ in from
the sandy desert. Hit ’er up!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Listen then to what he writes here,” Jack was
saying, soberly, yet keeping an eye on Perk’s tell-tale
face, which he never could wholly control:
“‘The enclosed suggestions are clippings, and reports
from some of our agents who had started
out to track this ugly gang to its secret hideout.
Taken collectively and individually they will convince
you as to the character of many of the knotty
problems you will have to solve before success can
be your reward in smashing this new King Cole
mob of law breakers, cattle thieves, bank robbers,
and what-not along the line of up-to-date crime.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘So you will understand the magnitude of this
business when I tell you it is not only suspected,
but fully believed, this so-called King Cole is an
old offender, sailing under a new name—none
other than a clever convict whose escape from the
Atlanta penitentiary some months ago has been
purposely kept a state secret, in hopes of its being
helpful in locating his whereabouts, and bringing
him back to his empty cell, with the penalty of
having his sentence lengthened on account of his
flight—an arrangement that so far has not been
in the least profitable or successful.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘You will understand what I mean when I tell
you the name of this rascal, whom I remember
you and your comrade had the high honor of bringing
before the courts, and starting on the road to
the Government institution—it is’”—Jack paused
to watch Perk’s eager face, and then added with
considerable force: “‘it is Slippery Slim Garrabrant!’”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c015'>CHAPTER VI <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Laying Plans</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! my gosh!”</p>

<p class='c011'>So completely staggered did Perk seem to have
become at the disclosure made by Jack, that he sat
there, incapable of motion, just staring at his
companion in the manner of a man who thinks he
sees a hobgoblin.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Slim—Slim Garrabrant!” he finally mustered
up enough breath to almost whisper, looking a bit
awed, Jack thought.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No other, partner,” his pal assured him, cheerfully.
“You know how we were saying that sometimes
this old world looked mighty small—well,
this happens to be one of those times. Take it as
a matter of fact, Perk—one of those quirks that
roll around occasionally.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeah—sure, that’s right, Jack—jest so—nawthin’
awful strange ’bout him aturnin’ aout
to be the lucky dog as skipped aout o’ the pen, giving
Uncle Sam the laugh. Go on an’ tell me some
more. Kinder looks like we’d got to roll aour hoop
up agin that Smart Aleck again, ’fore we get him
caged for keeps.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I don’t know about that, matey,” Jack
told him, frowning as he spoke; “but if they <i>do</i> get
him back alive in his cell they’ll keep closer tabs on
Slim, you can wager. But the devil of it is, can he
ever be retaken? Both of us have good reason to
remember what a big job we had on our hands
the other time; which isn’t to be compared with
what we’ll stack up against now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk had by this time succeeded in getting back
his customary self reliance, when he would scoff
at such a word as “can’t.” He screwed his face up
in what evidently was intended to be a sneer, as he
went on to say:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! that ere is the last thing to worry me,
buddy. Yeou an’ me, guess we make a team not
easy to beat. When we git started we’ll jest give
that gink a knock fur a goal, an’ clinch the game
for keeps. But like as not we orter be makin’ up
aour plans, hadn’t we, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly,” responded the other, calmly; “but
first of all let it be distinctly understood in the
beginning there’s no need of any undue hurry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Course not,” agreed Perk, wagging his head
in the affirmative, as was his usual habit when Jack
was laying down the law.</p>

<p class='c011'>“While of course we’ll not loiter on the way,”
continued the head man of the combination; “just
the same we must not do anything that’s going to
interfere with our customary efficiency—no going
off at half-cock, like a gun that’s in need of lock
repairs.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk chuckled as if highly edified.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say, partner,” he hastened to remark, “not
much danger o’ sech a thing happenin’ with <i>yeou</i>
runnin’ the lead, I give yeou my affidavy on that
same.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s all blarney, Perk; and don’t depend on
my being free from stumbling in the dark—I’m
only human, and can make silly mistakes, like every
known pilot—even Lindbergh’s had the misfortune
to smash his landing gear when making an ascent,
and with the girl he afterwards married, remember.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure thing, Jack, but didn’t he manage a
wonderful landin’, an’ keep from a bad smashup,
on’y hurtin’ his shoulder in the jam?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and Perk, some people attribute his escape
to good luck; but I know full well it was his
skill in understanding just what to do in an emergency.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, what’s aour programme agoin’ to be?”
demanded the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>“First of all, then, we’ve got to study those
enclosures the Chief sent in his letter—they’ll give
us a good many important points, and it may be
locate this secret hideout of the crowd that’s
bothering Uncle Sam so much. Get that, do you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m on, boss—go to it some more,” replied
Perk, blithely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As we shall be scouring one of the wildest and
most dreaded parts of the whole Rockies,” continued
Jack, “of course it’ll be necessary for us to
carry a big cargo of stuff along—plenty of supplies
in the line of grub, as well as gas and oil.
Then, since we are bound to line up, sooner or
later, against the whole gang, we must tote tear-bombs,
and some of the destructive ones, such as
we’ve been forced to make use of before.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sounds okay to me, ole hoss,” Perk assented,
looking particularly well pleased at the possibility
of wild action, which these preliminary remarks
of his leader seemed to presage—doubtless his
wonderful memory carried him back to the previous
occasion when they went out after Slim
Garrabrant, and dragged him before the bar of
justice, a feat which earned them the commendation
of the Big Chief, as well as a nice step upwards
in the way of increased pay.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although in many things Perk took no man’s
dust when it came to a knowledge of flying activities,
and air knowledge; just the same he felt
it no disgrace to “sit at the feet” of his best pal,
and imbibe information when the plan of campaign
was being laid out—Perk freely admitted he was
“not so good,” along such lines—ready to shift
the responsibility to Jack’s shoulders, yet joyfully
bear his share of all subsequent action.</p>

<p class='c011'>The papers were divided up, and both of them
read steadily for some time, occasionally exchanging
observations, with Perk asking frequent questions
concerning matters that were not quite clear
to his rather slow mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this fashion, just as wise Jack knew would be
the case, both of them gradually got “heated up,”
with the fervor of the case—indeed, this view
of matters was also taken by his companion, since
Perk declared it made him think of how they used
to get a tracking hound to smell some garment
worn by the child that was lost, so he could take
the trail, and follow it to a successful finish.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Which I vum will be aour way o’ clappin’ hands
on this slippery kiote, once we git agoin’ strong,”
he went on to add, with supreme confidence, it
appeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One thing we’ve got to remember,” Jack mentioned;
“which is about keeping our light hidden
under a bushel. Men who follow our dangerous
profession must never get themselves in the public
prints if it can be avoided; and as for standing up
to be in the spotlight, so all people can take note of
their looks, it just isn’t done, you know, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Possibly there may have been occasions in the
past when, after they had been unusually successful
in landing their man, Perk had shown a disposition
to talk a bit too much—grant interviews
to newspaper reporters, who were apt to go into
details covering some of the ways such sleuths
outwitted those whom they hunted; all of which
was bad for their being successful in forthcoming
missions of like character, since the lawbreakers
would avidly seize upon all such printed matter, to
size up the methods that were utilized in bringing
about the downfall of men of their stamp.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeah, course that’s the right thing—we’ll jest
keep aour own counsel an’ do the gittin’ o’ aour
stuff together withaout beating the gong an’
’tractin’ the mob’s attention. We wouldn’t live up
to aour reputation as sleuth hounds if we didn’t
work undercover, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fine for you, brother,” he was told; “I’m
tickled pink to know you’re waking up to the necessity
for Secret Service men keeping away from
the glare of publicity, even if they have to lose
much credit; like editors of the big newspapers,
who never put even their initials to the strong
articles they write everyday.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In this fashion did Jack usually apply himself
to eradicating certain weaknesses that afflicted
his best pal, knowing that in so doing he was helping
Perk to become more efficient; also more valuable
in the service of the Government.</p>

<p class='c011'>After some hours spent in this fashion, they
found themselves pretty well inoculated with the
most salient points connected with their latest
task; and both of them were glad when it began
to grow dark, with supper in prospect.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I rather think we’re pretty well fed up on this
stuff,” Jack finally took occasion to remark, getting
up from his easy-chair, and stretching his cramped
legs; “so how about dropping it all, and going out
to feed our complaining tummies?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I aint got any objections to that ere business,
buddy,” Perk quickly observed, following suit in
leaving his seat, and going through certain motions
such as office sitters carry out in accordance with
radio instructions each and every morning, before
going forth to the daily grind. “They c’n
boast all they likes ’bout the belles o’ the ballroom;
the sweet janglin’ o’ the bells in the Spanish Missions
up ’long the Coast here, an’ even the never-to-be-forgotten
schoolbell; but for <i>me</i> they aint
nawthin’ to make my heart sing with joy like the
good ole-fashioned dinnerbell.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ve got plenty of company in that same
worship, Perk,” the other told him, “A few people
eat to live; but the biggest bunch live to eat. Let
hard times come, and they’ll do without a good
many things, but must have three meals a day—yes,
and with men, their regular smoke as well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>After leaving their cozy room, to walk along
the street, business was tabooed; they must forget
such personal affairs, and talk of anything under
the sun save what engrossed their minds chief of
all.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack had stressed this point when laying down
that rule for their guidance, saying practically as
follows:</p>

<p class='c011'>“We don’t understand as yet just what the
ramifications or extent of this combination of lawbreakers
is; for all we know they may be organized,
and doing such a big business that they
can employ spies in certain cities, to pick up valuable
pointers; informing them of profitable strikes
on Western trails, and along railroads where
treasure is being daily carried east and west; besides
that, these spies would be on the watch to
learn of plans for bringing members of the gang
to justice—for all we know they have been keeping
tabs on <i>our</i> movements right along; and may be
in possession of considerable knowledge covering
our being the ones commissioned by Headquarters
to proceed against them. On this account it is up
to us to play the innocent, and when in a public
eating place never talk shop, especially if the room
is full, as is always the case here at suppertime.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was always so much common sense in
what Jack advanced that Perk could seldom grumble,
no matter if he did not wholly agree with his
partner. Besides, there were so many interesting
matters, as given out in the daily prints, and along
the line of aviation stunts, that they need never
lack for material to carry on their careless chatter
as they dined, and watched their neighbors, after
the usual manner of detectives on or off duty,
seeking to further add to their information as to
the possible presence of eavesdroppers.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c015'>CHAPTER VII <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Ready for Anything</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The following day was a busy one for the two
pals. Each had a regular programme to follow,
Jack having made out two lists of important things
absolutely essential to the carrying out of their
plans.</p>

<p class='c011'>As usually happened he left to Perk the task
of seeing that the ship was fully supplied with all
the fuel and oil she was capable of carrying off
in making an ascent; some of which could be stored
in the wings, purposely provided with stowage
room for such occasions.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then when it came to taking aboard a stock
of provisions, such as would not require cooking,
trust Perk for having a complete understanding as
to these requirements—he possessed such a vast
knowledge of what was good for a hungry man,
not in a position to start a campfire, that when he
put the last of their stock away aboard the plane
it looked as if they might be getting ready to explore
the Arctic regions, where nothing but driftice
was to be met, and no chance of having a fire
either for cooking or comfort.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack, meanwhile did his part, making carefully
arranged plans, with alternate makeshifts such as
could be taken up in case unsurmountable obstacles
baffled them in the one chosen for the start—with
Jack it was always part of his strategy to have
several “strings to his bow,” and never if possible
“put all his eggs in one basket.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When wearied after all the tramping he had
done in accumulating such a vast pile of material,
Perk dropped down into a chair alongside his chum—who
was still doing the finishing touch to his
programme—he heaved a sigh as of contentment—as
a rule Perk was not a vigorous walker, preferring
to go by airplane, motorcar, or bus; perhaps
even by stage if necessary, so that such unusual
exercise told heavily on his muscles.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Get through with your list, partner?” queried
Jack, shoving aside his papers, as though he too
had had quite enough of work for one day.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure did, matey,” came the satisfied reply;
“we’re done loaded up to the limit, an’ then some.
Hope the ole gal don’t fight shy o’ liftin’ sech a
rummy cargo; but so far we aint never had her
balk on us. How yeou gittin’ on with things, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Making good progress,” came the steady answer.
“I’ve learned that we’ve shouldered a whopping
big job this time; and still things keep
cropping up, that make it necessary to go back and
change matters some. But I’ll be in fine shape by
tomorrow noon, I figure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Kinder reckon on makin’ the jump then, air
yeou, boss?” demanded Perk.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack shook his head in the negative.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Better wait up until night-time, buddy,” he
explained. “An ounce of prevention’s always a
heap better than a pound of cure, you remember.
We can slip away a lot easier in the night, as we’ve
proven more than a few times in the past. Then
besides, we’d like to profit by the latest weather
report. If a wide storm threatened it would be good
policy to hold back even for several days, rather
than get caught in a hard blow; such things are
said to be doubly tough amidst the mountain
gorges and canyons, with their cranky air currents,
and a continual danger of running smack
into some high peak.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I leaves all that figgerin’ to yeou, as usual,
partner; when yeou gives the word, that’s goin’ to
be the right time for us to climb, an’ not afore.
Golly! but I’m as hungry as seven wolves all in one—hopes
as haow they got steak an’ fried onions on
the bill o’ fare tonight, ’cause my innards air jest
a yellin’ fur a mess o’ my fav’rite chow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can’t say I’m in the same box, because being
shut up for hours, and badgering my poor brain
with a hundred puzzling questions, isn’t calculated
to make a man ferociously hungry. You had outdoor
exercise, and in consequence have built up a
glorious appetite. Queer what some fellows <i>will</i> do
so as to cater to their thirst or hunger.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Naow whatever kin yeou mean by that same
remark, Jack, ole boy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>They were on their way along the street at the
time, keeping step as they headed for the restaurant.
Jack seemed agreeable so far as explaining,
for there was a little yarn back of his words, just
as the astute Perk had suspected, knowing his
chum as well as he did.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This story was told to me long years ago, but I
never think of it that I don’t get a fresh laugh,”
Jack was saying, chuckling as he spoke. “It seems
a couple of artists who were fond of trout fishing
were up in Maine, stopping at a small hotel, while
waiting for their guides to show up.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They noticed at breakfast several mornings
that another party, small and dried up, but a fisherman
to the tips of his fingers nevertheless, always
ordered salt mackerel for his morning meal.
This aroused their curiosity, so one day, after
having a good confab with him on the prospect of
sport ahead on the trip they had planned to take,
one of the pair had the audacity to refer to the
singular liking for such a dish evinced by the
other. He grinned and looked wise, as he went on
to say in reply, not taking the least offense over the
matter as a personal one:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Oh! I aint carin’ so much for the fish, gents,
an’ gets fed up on the same sometimes; but let me
tell you, folks ’long ’bout ten o’clock every mornin’
there comes the most delicious <i>thirst</i> that pays
up for my eating them salt fish.’ Think of him
punishing himself so regularly, just to create a
tremendous yearning for his favorite tipple.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk saw the point, and of course laughed quite
vigorously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hot-diggetty-dig! boy, hope I aint jest as bad
as that same gent,” he presently gurgled. “I c’n
understand heow he felt though, an’ she don’t seem
so derned queer to me after all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack often managed to get off some such yarn
when the necessity arose for keeping the talkative
Perk from “spilling the beans,” as the latter himself
would have explained it—Perk was a rather
simple minded fellow, taken in all, but a faithful
and sincere chum, a ready worker, and as brave
as they make them, even if a bit incautious, often
to recklessness in his actions.</p>

<p class='c011'>It seemed as though there were more people
dining that evening in the particular little restaurant
than ever before: but Joe had upturned two
chairs at their favorite corner table, toward which
Jack led the way; so they were assured of comfort,
even though late-comers were standing, awaiting
their turn.</p>

<p class='c011'>Both of them always made it a point never to
dress in any fashion such as would be apt to give
away the fact of their being airmen, or as having
some connection with the following of aviators.
This was done from a broad policy, founded on
the fact that undoubtedly rumors of their calling
might long ere this have posted criminal circles;
and Jack for one had no fancy about having gunmen
dogging his steps, with murder in their hearts,
because of the fact that this pair of “birds” had
been chiefly instrumental in sending some pal, or
brother, to the “big house” for a long stay, or it
might be to the chair to atone for his crimes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack always sat so he could look in careless
fashion around the room. His manner was that
of a social fellow, taking an inventory of the
diners, as though wondering if he could single
out some crony. There was nothing of the “eagle
eye that could look into a man’s very soul, and
read his hidden thoughts,” as usually connected
with the mystery story, or stage detective—not
about Jack, or for that matter Perk either—so
far as outward appearances went they were only
a couple of goodnatured young men, smiling and
agreeable, enjoying their meal, and chatting about
the latest stirring events of the day in the field
of sports, possibly also interested in political matters,
as would be natural.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk always declared he felt as though he had
put on a mask, when thus debarred from “talking
shop,” with curious ears so close by; but he
realized the necessity for such extreme caution,
when they were always pitted against the desperadoes
of the underworld in their daily work.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Somethin’ o’ a mob here tonight, partner?”
suggested Perk, after they had been served by
Joe, the waiter, and taken the edge off their appetites;
both having settled on the same aromatic
dish, which Perk was savagely attacking.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Looks that way, Perk; if this keeps on we’ll
have to find another place to feed, when we strike
San Diego again; since neither of us is partial
to crowds. Remember the old frontiersman who
complained that the neighborhood was getting too
thickly settled for him and his folks, because a
new family had started to build a log cabin less
than <i>seven miles away</i>? People look at what makes
a crowd with different viewpoints, we have to
remember; what is flesh to one is just poison to another
man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! never heard tell o’ that idear ’fore,” confessed
the interested Perk; “but it rings like there
might be somethin’ in the same. See anybody yeou
happens to know ’round here partner?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not one that I would be apt to speak to,”
Jack told him; “of course we see some of them
each night; but they’ve paid no attention to us,
for which we’re only too glad; doesn’t pay to pick
up chance acquaintances at haphazard, when you
happen to be engaged in a certain type of business.
If you reckon you’ve attended to that vacuum
downstairs we might as well be moving out, and
give some of the standup people a chance at this
table.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let’s get goin’ then,” agreed Perk, pushing
back his chair; which action caused several groups
of impatient waiting persons to start toward the
spot, so as to preempt the vacant table.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Show tonight, Jack?” queried the satisfied
Perk, as they moved along.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I ought to get busy once more on my stuff, as
my programme isn’t at all complete; but just the
same I don’t want to overdo such brain fatiguing
work, and have to lay off a spell—nothing to be
gained by such corrupt practices, I imagine. So,
since I know you feel as if you’d like to see something,
to take your mind off business for one
night, decide on where you want to go, and we’ll
be off.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Course I’m not really dead set on seeing any
picture,” apologized Perk; “but chances are we
aint agoin’ to have another whiff o’ a screen drama
for days and days; an’ it’ll fill in time, as well
as freshenin’ up yeour mind more’r less, buddy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>What they saw and heard does not concern us
in following up this, their latest exploit; but evidently
Perk fully enjoyed the night’s entertainment,
since he seemed to be in a jovial state
of mind all the way back to their sleeping
quarters.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their ship was quartered close to a well known
aviation field, where air mail was coming and
going at all hours of the day and night; as well
as privately owned planes of the very latest design,
some of them wonderful craft in which daring
adventurers could seek out the utmost parts of
the earth, backed of course, by an abundance of
necessary funds.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were not known under their real names
to any of those who from time to time they chanced
to meet and chat with. It was generally understood
however, that Jack was the son of a wealthy
family in the South—New Orleans to be specific;
and had come from Candler Field in Atlanta, with
his companion as assistant pilot. Moreover they
were believed to be waiting for certain things to
transpire, after which they meant to take an extended
jaunt down through South America, over
the Andes, and the vast wilderness of the Amazon
Valley, with its tributaries, engaged in collecting
myriads of wonderful orchids, said to have their
<i>habitat</i> in that torrid region.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus no one had bothered them to any extent—at
least not thus far; realizing that the young
explorer expressed a dislike about creeping into
print, and having his plans broadcast, so that
perhaps some rival plant hunter might “slip one
over” and beat him to the much prized field.</p>

<p class='c011'>They came and went, as they pleased in their
boat, making sure never to leave the slightest evidence
of their true calling lying around, which
would be apt to “lift the lid,” and give them away.
When Perk that very day was so busily engaged
loading up, it was all in line with their pretended
objective; entering into the spirit of the great
game of “pulling the wool over the eyes” of curious
fellow aviators, Perk took delight in concocting
an extravagant yarn, depicting some of the possible
adventures he anticipated running across
down in the countries of South America—Brazil,
the Orinoco River forest lands, Peru, Chili and
the Argentine—enough to make them envy his
good fortune, when tough Luck bound them in
fetters along the line of their more prosaic
jobs.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack was indeed through with the last item
on his lists by noon of the following day; but adhered
to his expressed policy of holding back their
launching until night came on. Perk, however,
made a last visit to the hangar in which their
beautiful ship lay quartered, to make doubly certain
he had omitted absolutely nothing that could
add to their comfort—and safety.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c015'>CHAPTER VIII <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>The Winged Messenger</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Coast seems to be clear, eh, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk asked this question as they reentered their
room, after having come back from supper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Looks that way, as far as I can see,” replied
his shipmate, throwing himself down in an easy-chair,
that seemed to invite attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No signs o’ aour bein’ spied on so far,” asserted
Perk, boldly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I saw nothing that looked suspicious, partner,”
continued the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Kinder had an idee that lanky goof at the table
’gainst the wall kept lookin’ aour way, like he
had a suspicion we’d bear watchin’—did yeou
happen to notice him, buddy—queer squint to one
o’ his lamps, an’ a turrible long nose that made
me think it jest longed to stick itself in other folks’
business.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack laughed as if highly amused.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So you reckoned he was some interested in us,
did you, Perk? Well, he had a right to be, I’d
say, if you asked me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s that, partner?” asked the stouter member
of the crew of the flying ship that was working
for Uncle Sam’s law and order department.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, he knew just who we were, and why
we chanced to be in old San Diego right now—get
that straight, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeou’re kiddin’ me, Jack,” whined Perk, looking
hurt.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I repeat what I said; and to make it plainer
I’m adding further that man you mention not
only knew us for what we are, but also why we
were whispering across our table so much, when
certain things came up that had to be discussed,
even against our general rule never to talk shop
when in public.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The devil he did!” ejaculated the astounded
Perk; “then why did yeou jest say there didn’t
seem to be any spy a hangin’ ’round on our tail,
to put them critters wise to our headin’ thataways—tell
me that, Mister?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ask me a hard one, brother,” Jack flashed
back, still amused it could be easily seen. “I’ll go
a step further, and say that he was tempted to
speak to us, perhaps even join us at our table; but
one thing kept him from doing so, which was the
iron-bound rule that one agent of Uncle Sam must
never thrust himself into any game that is being
conducted by another of the brotherhood.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk drew in a long breath, and stared at his
comrade.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Meanin’, I kinder guess, as heow that party
might be in the Secret Service like we air—does
that fill the bill, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just what it does,” he was told straight from
the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then—yeou <i>know</i> him, I’m understandin’
boy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I most certainly do, Perk—you’ve heard of
him many a time too, even if you’ve probably never
happened to run across him. That man’s one of
the smartest detectives in the whole shooting
match—his name, son, is Josiah Harper, sometimes
called The Hawk on account of his long
beak, and the fact that he possesses abnormal eyesight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk grinned as if relieved.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So, that’s the wonderful Hawk, is it, partner?”
he was saying, as if he found it difficult to grasp
the fact. “No, I never did run acrost him so far’s
I know. What in tarnation kin <i>he</i> be doin’ out this
way—yeou don’t figger he’s goin’ to butt in on
aour job, do yeou?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hardly that, Perk, I should say; if he was
we’d have been piped off to that effect. I reckon
he had orders to run over to San Diego to catch
us before we took off.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Does that mean he might be fetchin’ a last
hour message, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I figured that way,” came the ready answer;
“and following you across the room I managed
to rub up against Harper, to have a small slip
of paper pushed into my waiting hand. Here it
is, and we’ll see what it carries—some last hour
report, I fancy, that the Chief believes will come
in handy, sooner or later.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I swan!” gasped Perk, evidently considerably
tickled over the clever work carried
through by his companion, without any diner in
the restaurant being the wiser, so far as they
knew.</p>

<p class='c011'>For several minutes Jack appeared to be studying
the writing on the crumpled piece of rice paper
he had drawn from his vest pocket and straightened
out. No wonder, when the writing seemed
just a crazy mess of words, and figures—undoubtedly
a secret cipher used by the agents in their
particular branch of the Government Service,
when occasion arose to communicate with each
other.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack was so proficient in the cipher writing that
he could read it readily without applying the key;
in this case he evidently was weighing each terse
paragraph as he translated the same.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some important, I takes it, buddy?” observed
Perk, who had watched the other nodding his head
as he perused the message.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very, if we happen to be lucky enough to get
close to the hideout of the gang. This little scrap
of paper has a history, Perk. It was carried from
the mountains where this crowd hold out, to Los
Angeles by a feathered post.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I doan’t jest get yeou, partner—what’s a feathered
post—I never yet seen anything like that—yeou
got me sunk, Jack, boy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know what a carrier pigeon is, of course,
Perk—well, one of the two agents who were sent
out on this case several months ago conceived the
bright idea of carrying a bird with him. Just as
he feared might be the case they were eventually
discovered, and brought to bay in a rocky canyon—the
men wolves had them bottled up, so they
must either surrender and take the consequences,
or perish of hunger and thirst. He wrote this
message in code on this thin tissue paper, fastened
it under the wing of his bird, and tossed the
pigeon up in the air. It may have been fired at,
but since it showed up at its home cote in Angeles
it escaped being killed, or even crippled.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Great work that, partner,” snapped the intensely
interested Perk; “I shore takes off my hat
to the lad who could think up sech a neat dodge.
An’ right there clost to the tigers’ den he could
set daown an’ write a ’portant message in code,
so’s to send off his little birdie. That’s a new trick
on me, I own up—a stunt worth while.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack went on to interpret the contents of the
little missive that had been carried all the way
from the heart of the mountains. Perk listened
as if bent on letting each and every word sink
deeply into his receptive mind for future use.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Them ere directions for locatin’ the place
where they foregather, is shore valuable stuff fur
aour crowd, Jack, ole hoss,” he finally remarked,
after his chum had read the writing on the thin
paper twice, putting due emphasis on certain
words that had an apparently significant meaning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Particularly Perk, that part describing a
splendid landing-field some miles distant, where
we could drop down safely, and without getting
close enough to the haunt for sharp ears to catch
the noise of a ship’s exhaust.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wust thing ’bout human bloodhounds huntin’
their prey in a bus—never will seem right to me
’til they fix things so’s we kin creep up on aour
prey without tellin’ the hull world a airplane is
somewhere ’round. Think that happy day ever
will come, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure it will, Perk, and we’ll see it to—if it
so happens we haven’t already crashed, and gone
west. Why not, when such wonderful advances
are being made in aviation circles every moon.
Right now we’re doing a lot of amazing stunts
with our ships that were never dreamed of five
years ago. Anything is possible, now they’ve got
started taking to the air.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! it was time all right,” grunted Perk;
“when yeou see haow all the highways air gettin’
glutted with autos, ’specially clost to big cities.
Even San Diego folks find it hard to git ’round on
Sundays an’ holidays. But this fresh happenin’
sorter gives me a hunch we’re agoin’ to make the
ripple, an’ fetch home the bacon after all—things
they air all workin’ thataways.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had the last word from the weather man,”
Jack went on to add; “and I’m sorry to say it
wasn’t quite as fine as I’d like.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Storm agoin’ to hold us up, mebbe naow, partner?”
suggested Perk, with one of his impatient
frowns, as he disliked very much being balked
in any plan.</p>

<p class='c011'>“N—no, not quite that bad; but there are reports
of a nasty field of fog gathering in the direction
of the mountains far back from the coast;
but we’ll have to take our chances, now we’re fixed
for the jump—it may not turn out as bad as they
reckon on. Let’s get ready to slip off, Perk.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c015'>CHAPTER IX <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Headed for Trouble</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>An hour later the two adventurers arrived at
the San Diego aviation grounds, having taken
a taxi to carry them and their limited luggage.</p>

<p class='c011'>The night was a fine one, so far as the star-studded
heavens could be taken as an indication. If
there was fog gathering some hundreds of miles
distant along the route of the air mail course,
no indication of such worry to the pilot’s peace
of mind had reached this coastal station.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Goin’ to have a right decent start, looks like,”
Perk mentioned, after they had dismissed the
taxi close to the isolated hangar just outside the
aviation field limits.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I expected we’d have it clear as a bell,” Jack
told him, as he unlocked the doors of the hangar;
“just as well that we don’t have our troubles strike
us before we even hit our pace—time enough for
all that when we get well on our way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As Jack had anticipated there was light aplenty
for their purpose; ships were coming and going
at this early time in the evening, so that the field
lights were all on, making it easy to see.</p>

<p class='c011'>Secrecy was such a part of their business that
they did not even have hostlers present to help
push their bus out to the runway—it would not be
the first occasion when these two energetic fellows
had managed all such things by themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>They did not loiter, now that the final take-off
was at hand; Jack was a little afraid lest some
mechanic, or pilot, hearing them working, and
being more or less curious concerning the pair
who owned the trim aircraft in which they had
been taking trips for weeks past, (and about
whom a halo of mystery hovered) might come nosing
around, offering to lend a hand, but really hoping
to pick up a few words that would explain
their leaving under cover of night—honest to
goodness sportsmen, going off for a hunt, or a
fishing jaunt to the mountains, would not be apt
to time their departure while the world was smothered
in darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were now poised on the short runway,
and ready to start off. Perk had followed his mate
aboard, and was already busying himself with
certain preliminary duties that always fell to his
charge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ready, all?” called out Jack.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Give her the gun, partner!” replied Perk.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a sudden roar as the engine took the
spark, a quiver of the entire craft, and then a quick
jerk as Jack moved the throttle toward his chest.
Down the slight slope they started, gathering
more headway with every second until the ship
was bumping rapidly over the ground, her skid
already beginning to scorn the soil as if eager
to take to the air.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then her nose being pointed upwards she began
to rise like a bird, passing well over the trees that
stood at the end of the course.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were off on their momentous and perilous
mission; only Fate knew what the result would
prove to be; whether success awaited them, or
failure, perhaps even death; for they were bound
on an errand to a country where the majesty of
the Law was scorned, where might meant right,
and men did not place much value on a human
life, more or less.</p>

<p class='c011'>To see how joyous Perk seemed to be no one
would imagine he gave much heed to the prospect
of thrilling episodes that would threaten them
as soon as they entered the danger zone. But then
that was the way with Perk, who loved adventure
and close calls, and was never happier than when
defying the power of lawless men, badly wanted
by those higher-ups in charge of the famous Secret
Service.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lighted aviation field was quickly left far
behind, as Jack headed into the northeast, with
the intention of holding to the beacon-lighted trail
of the air mail up to a certain point; when they
must abandon those welcome markers that flashed
their intelligence every ten seconds, and were so
useful for keeping the mail carriers on their proper
course.</p>

<p class='c011'>Like most up-to-date pilots Jack and his mate
had supplied themselves with the handy ear-phones,
by adjusting which to their heads they
could communicate in a satisfactory fashion when
it became necessary. But for this wise preparedness
they would have had to shout at the top of
their lungs in order to pass a few words back and
forth—a most unsatisfactory way of doing, as
every pilot has found out in times gone by, when
there was no other method known.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a full hour they kept on their way persistently
following the air mail route. It was exceedingly
refreshing to be able to note as many as three
flashing beacons at the same time, from the four
thousand foot ceiling at which Jack was flying,
the further one rather dim, it is true; but strong
enough to catch the watchful eye of the pilot.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk had kept “bottled up” as long as he could
stand it, and now broke out as if eager to ask
some sort of question that was on his mind. Under
such conditions it was his usual way to gradually
approach the matter by jerks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! pretty soft I’d call it, partner, if yeou
troubled to ask me,” he observed as an opener.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As what?” demanded Jack, tersely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The job o’ bein’ an air mail runner—everything
fixed for ’em so’s they kin keep on the right
track—who’d lose his way with them friendly
flash-light beacons apoppin’ up ev’ry ten miles’r
so, I want to know?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’re away off your reckoning when you say
that, Perk; remember how they’ve got to meet up
with tough storms; and pea soup fogs you could
cut with a knife, they’re so thick. And in parts
of their run the country is treacherous, with slants
of wind breaking out of deep canyons; then, too,
if anything goes wrong aboard their boat to make
a safe landing on such rocky ground is full of all
kinds of difficulties. No, the air mail pilot doesn’t
have such a sweet time of it as you seem to think—a
night like this he can consider a peach; only
there are not many built that way. You know they
lots of times insist on starting out when a wheen
of pilots would stay safe on the ground, and not
take desperate chances.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Partner, yeou’ll have to excuse haste an’ a bad
pen, as the pig said after breaking out, and skippin’
off on a full run. That time I shore didn’t count
ten ’fore I broke loose. Guess naow all pilots git up
agin hard fixes onct in a while, where the finest
flash beacons in the hull world caint help ’em
any. I kin understand haow it aint possible to
lamp them lights atall through a thick fog—on’y
by the altitude marker kin yeou tell if youre
aflying sky high, or near scraping the ground. But
did yeou happen to hear a ship takin’ off jest after
we slid aout, boss?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but that didn’t give me any concern, Perk.
No danger of it’s being any spy interested in following
<i>us</i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But jest the same, Jack, she’s been keepin’ on
aour tail right along,” protested the watchful one,
as if he might have been worried a bit.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why not, when like as not the pilot is carrying
the U. S. mail, and on his reg’lar night run north.
We happen to be making use of his lights, that’s
all; and he’s attending to his usual business. When
we sheer off to the east soon now, leaving these
flashlights behind, <i>then</i> if you discover a ship following
after us it’ll be time to do something, not
before.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thanks, partner; jest thought I had orter tell
yeou, that’s all,” and with that Perk lapsed into
silence again, having worked his mind clear once
more.</p>

<p class='c011'>Further time passed.</p>

<p class='c011'>They had covered some hundreds of miles since
leaving San Diego, and Jack, watching his map
understood the time was close at hand for him
to alter his course, and turn sharply toward the
east, while the lighted mail line of travel continued
northward.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ten minutes afterwards and Perk again broke
out.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I kin see the fust wisps o’ that ere fog yeou
was a tellin’ ’baout, boss,” he announced grimly, as
though appreciating the flashing beacons more
than before, now that they were about at the end
of their string, with the whole world of mountainous
ground facing them, so full of hidden
snares and pitfalls, not to mention human tigers
with a fierce vendetta against all those busybodies
of their particular breed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s interesting news, but not so delightful,
Perk, since I’m just going to switch, and head
into the east.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c015'>CHAPTER X <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Battling with the Fog</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Thanks to his carefully studied chart Jack knew
just about when he must head into the east, and
make for the disputed land, where fugitives from
justice had long kept away from the long arm of
the Law. In former days there had been just such
a safe hiding-place further to the north, locally
known as the “Hole in the wall;” but it was of the
past, and for some years had been thrown open
to settlers and tourists.</p>

<p class='c011'>The die was cast, and for better or worse they
had made their decision; but neither of them had
any disposition to turn back. Danger and these
men of the Force were accustomed to being familiar
campmates; since there was no mission on
which they could be sent but had its share of peril;
if such expeditions were but picnics it would not
be so necessary to dispatch the prize men of the
Service on the track, where others had failed after
shooting their bolt.</p>

<p class='c011'>Speedily were they swallowed up in the night.
Far distant, and in the east a mellow light low-down
announced the rising of the moon, now far
advanced in its last quarter. Jack did not count
for any assistance in the rising of the uncrowned
queen of the night, since already he could see the
gathering fog was growing thicker every passing
minute.</p>

<p class='c011'>Several times he lost the remnant of moon entirely,
to have it creep into view again, as though
the thick vapor had temporarily opened up; but
only to close in again worse than ever, until the
glimpse of the climbing orb came no more.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus began their fight with the fog—its insidious
influence seemed to shut them in like an
opaque curtain, growing more and more dense as
the minutes moved along.</p>

<p class='c011'>Realizing that they were now heading into that
stretch where they might expect to meet with lofty
mountain peaks, and crags, Jack began a steady upward
climb, being most desirous of taking no
unnecessary chances of crashing against a rock
cliff that was hidden from their view by the creeping
fog.</p>

<p class='c011'>It seemed to be a most extraordinary fog, all
told, Perk explained to his own satisfaction. Usually
when thus compassed around about by a
dense sea of vapor, and unable to take any sort of
reckoning by means of the heavens above, or the
earth beneath, this trouble could be remedied by
climbing still further into the region of the clouds,
and thus finding an altitude where the air was
sweet and pure, even if a bit shivery.</p>

<p class='c011'>Apparently that was not going to answer in the
present case. Jack had ascended until they were already
some eight thousand feet from the earth;
but if anything their enemy the fog appeared to
be more dense than ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>In fact, it did not seem worth while to pursue
this system of tactics any further, in order to beat
the enshrouding blanket of sticky wetness—why,
if they kept on much longer, the cold increasing
the higher they lifted their ship, that same dripping
moisture would be turning into <i>ice</i>, and the
additional weight was apt to play havoc all around.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t seem to be any let-up to the derned stuff,
Jack,” Perk at this time observed in the ear of his
running mate.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bad medicine, all right—don’t like it one bit,
partner,” came just the answer Perk would have
sworn his pal would make.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Seems like there aint nawthin’ we kin do to
make things easier, eh, buddy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Must peg away, keeping our nose pointed east,
and ready to drop down lower if given half a
show,” was how the head pilot answered him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeah! don’t ’pear to be anythin’ else in sight,
an’ its sure gettin’ mighty cold ’raound these diggin’s,
boy. I’m agoin’ to drag aout my heavy fleece-lined
coat, an’ climb into the same jest for fun.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go to it, old chap; and after you’re settled give
me a chance to follow through, since I’m beginning
to shiver as if I had the ague. This cold of
the upper air currents is a heap worse than any
we run into on the ground—seems to go all through
you like a knife. Phew!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Apparently Jack was not yet satisfied to drop
lower; he would give their present altitude a little
more chance to show what it could do in pressing
the beastly fog down in the direction of the earth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thunder an’ Mars! aint it awful thick,
though?” Perk was telling himself, as he rubbed
the glass, and did his best to pierce the miserable
stuff by which they were thus bound, so they had
no power to break loose. “Don’t b’lieve I ever did
see such a mess in all my days. Talk ’bout flyin’
blind, if we aint adoin’ that same right naow I’ll eat
my hat!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Flying blind—yes, that name seemed most appropriate.
Perk could look away back to his childhood,
and see the boys and girls playing—himself
with a handkerchief over his eyes, and trying to
grope his way around so as to lay hold of the active
dodgers who slipped out of his grip so adroitly.
But he also remembered, with a chuckle, how as a
rule it was always possible for the bandage to be
lifted just a little, allowing the chaser slight
glimpses of those whom he was supposed to trap,
and catch hold of.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! no sech luck in this here game up ’bove
the clouds,” Perk grumbled, as if much provoked
because there was no chance to “peep”—that pea-soup
sea covering so many miles in every direction
was absolutely impenetrable; and their only resource
would be to depend on their reliable instruments;
keep their wits about them, so as to know
how far they were going in a certain direction;
and when relief came be able to about pick their
position on the map.</p>

<p class='c011'>That was supposed to be Jack’s affair, and Perk
felt quite willing to trust his side partner to the
limit; whatever Jack decided on he was ready to
make unanimous, and let it go at that; so why
worry his poor brain when his pal was so much
better equipped for handling things?</p>

<p class='c011'>Still, he <i>did</i> worry—it would not have been Perk
otherwise; for he found all manner of grewsome
possibilities crowding into his mind such as must
give him what he called “the willies.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hot-diggetty-dig!” he grumbled to himself “but
this <i>is</i> a nasty mixup we’ve tumbled into. Jack,
he says to me the weather reports tell haow there
seems to be a bit of fog aformin’ off to the mountings—say,
if they calls this a <i>bit</i> I wonder what
a real smashin’ big fog’d seem like. From the way
she acts I’m commencin’ to figger as haow she
could keep this way right along fur a hull day’nd
night, withaout fazin’ any; an’ that’s no bunk
either. S’pose it does that same, what’s bound to
happen to us dicks runnin’ wild up here, I want to
know?”</p>

<p class='c011'>That was always Perk’s trouble—anticipating
things long before they were really due. He even
figured out how, with gas and supplies running
low, in the end they might have to make a perilous
forced landing, taking most desperate chances of
a calamitous smash.</p>

<p class='c011'>It kept him on “needles and pins” to have such
a dire threat loom up so soon after their takeoff,
with the work connected with their mission entirely
in the future, and unaccomplished.</p>

<p class='c011'>How the minutes did seem to drag when they
were pretty much in the dark as to the progress
their ship was making; or whether they had managed
to hold on to the course set by Jack in the
beginning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! it’s like gropin’ ’raound yeour bedroom in
the pitch dark, when wakin’ up from a bad dream—kinder
lose yeour head, an’ get sorter nutty
in the bargain. Mebbe we’re miles an’ miles eouten
the way, even gettin’ wuss rattled right along; but
say, that aint like my partner, to lose his head, an’
run us into a blind sack. I jest <i>got</i> to depend on
Jack to pull us through—aint I seen him come eout
right-side up heaps o’ times when things they
had an <i>aw</i>ful black look?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Taking himself to task after this fashion Perk
rose up out of his state of despondency, and actually
forced himself to chuckle, as if things looked
perfectly all right in his eyes; but there was something
lacking in the sound, something superficial,
and his seeming hilarity did not last long.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus it happened that once, when Jack, believing
they were attaining too great altitude, took a slide
down, shutting off the power; Perk felt positive
he again caught a sound from somewhere that
must certainly have come from the exhaust of an
airship motor, running at full speed!</p>

<p class='c011'>The thought gave him a momentary thrill, it
seemed so pregnant of accumulating possibilities
in the line of hazards; his old fear lest they should
have been surreptitiously followed by some secret
enemy, in the shape of an ally of the men they
sought to run down, returned in full force, to
stab him most viciously.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c015'>CHAPTER XI <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>The Mystery Airship</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“I say, Jack!” Perk called, making use of the
friendly ear-phones.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s eating you, buddy?” demanded the
other, who must have known from his comrade’s
shifting about so much there was something amiss.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did yeou hear it?” asked Perk, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You mean that sound in the fog pack, don’t
you?” Jack countered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeah, yeou said it, partner—I kinder guess
naow it was a ship up here in this same sea we’re
buzzin’ through, don’t yeou?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Couldn’t be anything else, because we’re thousands
of feet away from ground,” Jack admitted;
and somehow it gave his chum a feeling of relief
to notice how his voice showed no signs of sudden
alarm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As haow would yeou make it eout to be—some
bewildered air-mail pilot loose in his bearin’s,
and shootin’ ahead, thinkin’ he could get somewhere
right speedy, so’s to find his course agin?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not any, Perk; and you’ll realize that much if
you figure things out in a matter-of-fact way.
They don’t have greenhorns in the air-mail service,
or carrying passengers on the big lines—every
applicant for a job has got to have a thousand
hours at least in the air, and even at that he
isn’t reckoned to have won his spurs. If such an
experienced flier got balled up in this fog blanket
he’d do just what we’re carrying out—depend
utterly on his instruments. His compass would
tell him he could never regain his course by flying
<i>due east</i>!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s what he’s adoin’ then, yeou figger, eh,
Jack?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure thing, boy—he’s directly behind us, and
getting closer right along, for the sounds keep
growing louder.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Guess that’s so, partner—I kinder had an
idee he was on aour tail. What’s the answer,
Jack?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Another dive, maybe two in fact, so as to
leave him this ceiling to himself. We can climb
again, buddy, after he’s passed us, and pushes
further on his way. That’s the only sensible thing
to do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk had been allowing his mind to picture a
battle royal up there in cloudland, amidst the fog
mists, where machine-guns might rattle just as
years ago they always did when bitter foes over
on the French border came in contact, while bent
on forays that took them on long air voyages, to
bomb forbidding ammunition dumps, and thickly
manned trenches back of No Man’s Land.</p>

<p class='c011'>In imagination he had already heard the terrible
long roll being sounded by the chattering
quick-firing guns; with a hail of missiles sweeping
all around them, like a swarm of enraged hornets
as experienced in his own boyhood days.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Jack, who kept his imagination under better
control, did not look at things in the same way—his
idea was not to accept the gage of battle when
diplomacy and clever tactics could shift it on to
some future date, when the chances might be more
in their favor.</p>

<p class='c011'>What a partner to have at your side when things
looked more or less dubious—Perk drew a long
breath as of relief, and inwardly blessed the day
he paired up with Jack Ralston.</p>

<p class='c011'>There, once more they were shooting almost
straight down into that bewildering sea of fog.
It could not but give even seasoned Perk the thrill
of his life, as he contemplated what would happen
should they dash against some isolated mountain
crag or peak, while rushing along at this tremendous
speed.</p>

<p class='c011'>He held his breath during the score of seconds
they occupied in thus seeking another ceiling.
Then the quivering ship, under Jack’s skillful guidance,
glided into a level course, and Perk breathed
naturally once more.</p>

<p class='c011'>While the swift descent continued he had listened
intently, and was overjoyed to note how
the distinct clamor of the other plane’s motor
gradually grew fainter, thus proving that they
must be increasing the distance separating the
two hidden airships.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack, one eye on his altitude instrument, even
brought about another dip, during which Perk
failed to catch even the faintest mutter of a working
motor; which fact seemed to prove beyond dispute
their object had been achieved—the unseen
flying craft had been given all rights to that upper
ceiling, and all danger of a chance collision in the
sky lanes was avoided, at least for the time being.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were still heading into the east, with a
shade running toward northeast, as though Jack
continued to hold fast to his belief they were
following the proper course. It required the most
wonderful grasp upon the situation, as Perk well
knew, to keep going so confidently through such
an ocean of dense fog, utterly unable to see any
obstacle threatening them ahead.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk, absolutely content to leave all matters of
this sort in the hands of the partner who had never
as yet failed him in a pinch, found himself wondering
what that decision, given so assuredly by
his companion, might signify—if not a lost air-mail
pilot, then who could the unknown voyager,
shooting so recklessly through the pea-soup sea,
be?</p>

<p class='c011'>They were again ascending, proving that Jack
understood what additional chances for a mishap
they were tempting at the lower level, and wished
to play safe as soon as he could do so with the
unknown ship having passed on into the unseen
vacuum ahead.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again did the temperature approach close to
the freezing point, and no wonder, with their ship
soaring at such a height; but in that part of the
mountainous country they must expect to find
lofty uplifts mounting to the clouds, many thousands
of feet above all comfortable atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk busied himself in moving around, following
such duties as devolved on his shoulders while
his partner handled the stick. His chief concern
lay in the direction of finding out just when the
dense vapor began to form a thin coating of ice
on the wings.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the coming of such an insidious enemy
their danger increased ten-fold, since by degrees
it would add enough weight to the already heavily
laden ship as to force it down all too speedily, with
what hidden perils lying in wait below as only a
lively imagination could vision.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still that question remained unanswered—try as
he might Perk seemed unable to successfully
grapple with so puzzling and knotty a problem—if
not a mail pilot off his course, nor yet some
enemy trying to overtake, and run them down in
midair, then who could it be?</p>

<p class='c011'>With Perk bewildered the matter must inevitably
settle down to one well practiced means for
finding the answer to the enigma—“ask Jack—he
knows”—a formula as simple as anything could
be, also shifting all responsibility to other
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk went at it again, and asked for light.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mebbe naow, partner,” he called out, “it might
be yeou guessed this crazy flier up yonder was
some madcap pilot atryin’ to beat the record goin’
east from coast to coast; or else a locoed lad carryin’
a passenger who’d lose his hull fortune if so
be he didn’t land in Wall Street inside so many
hours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack laughed, as though amused at these vague
stabs—he knew what the other had in his mind by
going on in this fashion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just fishing again, eh, Perk—want to know
what I think covering the game, isn’t that so? Well,
listen, and I’ll put a flea in your ear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go to it, partner—I’m agreeable, an’ wantin’
to be informed,” Perk hastened to say.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Among those documents I examined there was
one fact I laid some stress on, which consisted of
a statement that the Secret Service man who sent
his report in, and then seemed to disappear utterly
from the knowledge of all men, declared it to be
his opinion these hideout big guns in the criminal
world, working under our old friend Slippery Slim
Garrabrant, had some sort of an <i>airship</i>, with
which they were doing a rattling good business—perhaps
you slipped up on that particular fact; but
I figured we might run across that plane, sooner
or later, and have considerable bother with the
same.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hot-diggetty-dig! then Jack, you mean it could
a been that crate we heard abeatin’ time on aour
tail; an’ mebbe chasin’ us like hot beans—tell me,
is that what hits you so hard, matey?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have a pretty strong idea it was their ship,
covering a well-known course from the coast to
this valley in the rocky unknown territory too
rough even to have been explored, as it was believed
to be worthless for even mining purposes.
As to whether those aboard were trying to strike
us in the fog, that’s still a mystery, and must remain
such for the present.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then do yeou guess they knowed we was ahead
on the same track, eh, Jack, ole hoss?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Remember Perk, that as far as we know they
didn’t change their ceiling at any time—just kept
booming away at the same level. That being the
case they couldn’t have heard the sound of our own
motor working, as their exhaust would deafen
them completely; for we only caught the racket
behind us when we were shooting the shoot, with
our engine shut-off.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good enough for us, buddy—then we got a
clear field ahead, an’ c’n foller aour own plans
right along.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For the time being; but don’t forget we’ve got
rough sledding ahead. It all depends on how long
we’ll be held fast in the grip of this accursed fog
pack. Running blind isn’t a very satisfactory way
of getting along, especially when you only know
the country through rude charts that may be all
right, and then again sprinkled with errors that
are bound to be full of danger to us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hit an’ miss, Jack, we’re used to takin’ the
chances—it’s all a part o’ the followin’ we’re rappin’
in. We jest got to do aour best, an’ leave the
rest—aint I been adoin’ that same mighty near all
my whole life? an’ seems like little ole Perk he’s
still on deck, able to eat his three good meals a
day—whenever he c’n git the same.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s after midnight, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So it be, partner; an’ we muster gone a good
many hundred miles since jumpin’ off—strikes
me we orter be clost to the goal we had in aour
minds; if so be we been keepin’ on a di-reck course,
with no wabblin’ to check us aout.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I figure that way myself,” replied Jack; “but
nothing can be done to make certain until conditions
change for the better.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Which would mean we got some hours to kill,
’fore mornin’ comes along to give us a show fur
aour money, eh, Jack, ole boy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s only one way to do that,” snapped the
other; “which is by circling around, keeping our
altitude, and within a range of say fifty miles; and
that’s what I’m aiming to start doing right now.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c015'>CHAPTER XII <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>When the Dawn Broke</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>When Jack thus decided it good policy to start
riding that gigantic circle, reducing their speed
at the same time, he knew it was really the only
course left to them in order to kill time, until there
arose a change in weather conditions, and the coming of daylight.</p>

<p class='c011'>It would require the utmost skill and vigilance
combined, thus to keep going over about the same
line of travel, with naught to depend upon save his
reliable instruments, aided by the deductions he
must be continually making, with his eyes on the
compass, the speed indicator, altimeter, and kindred
apparatus by means of which, in conjunction,
a clever pilot may cut circles around an objective
at will.</p>

<p class='c011'>All this when he has daylight to assist him, and
can see the distant ground beneath; but when
blinded by both fog and intense darkness it is
“a horse of another color” entirely, and if successfully
carried out may be considered on a par with
a near-miracle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He c’n do it, if anybody’s able,” faithful Perk
was assuring himself, as he sat and watched the
other go through with motion after motion, doubtless
mentally figuring up knotty little problems
in arithmetic that would either prove the accuracy
of his general plan of campaign, or cause him to
correct any faulty upsets.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gee whiz! if on’y we could a climbed on that
gink’s tail, an’ follered him to where he was agoin’,
what a soft snap it’d been,” Perk was telling himself,
as he imagined them climbing back to the
level followed by the “mystery ship,” and keeping
on at just a certain distance, where their presence
would not be betrayed by the commotion they
caused; “but it’s a hull lot too late neow to think
o’ tryin’ that ere stunt aout; so what’s the use
figgerin’ any more? ’Sides, they aint no chanct for
even a pilot what knows his beans ’raound this
pesky country, to drop daown, so long’s this soup
hangs over aour heads, under aour feet, an’ plays
the devil with things gen’rally. Jack’s got it all
laid aout, an’ we’re on aour way to Pike’s Peak—er
bust—mebbe so its jest plain <i>bust</i>!”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the time drew on Perk found himself engaged
in a peculiar game of guessing as to what
the character of the ground below would turn out
to be when they were given a blessed chance to
view the same by the dispersal of the fog, and the
coming of broad daylight.</p>

<p class='c011'>He knew what it meant to be hovering over
mountainous country, where all manner of weird
canyons and dry water courses could be traced
on the rough landscape—secluded haunt of the
Rocky Mountain sheep, or big-horn; the savage
silver-tip bear known also as the grizzly, most
dreaded wild beast of the entire Americas, the
claws of whom the Indians of the West always
prized as mementos of their individual valor, when
slain at close quarters, with the warrior living
to tell the story of his triumph.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, too, he could imagine vast herds of the
now almost extinct buffalo, seeking shelter and
grazing during the winter in some sheltered valley
among these same mountain ranges, where
green grass might be found in abundance even
during blizzard weather conditions.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once he gave full play to his fertile imagination,
and Perk would even forget the passage of
time; and this was just as well, since nothing he
could do would alter their situation in the slightest
degree; besides, it prevented him from worrying,
as he so often did.</p>

<p class='c011'>Along about three o’clock—as he knew by consulting
his wrist watch for the twentieth time since
their start—Perk had another little bright thought—what
was to hinder them from having a nice
snack, just to kill time, and cause them to feel
stronger for whatever might come along later on?</p>

<p class='c011'>Accordingly he got out a certain small packet
which he knew contained some sandwiches he had
paid their waiter to have made up for them, as a
souvenir of the much esteemed little restaurant in
San Diego, city of the Dons.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sitting there, and still keeping an observing eye
first on Jack, and then sweeping it around the
array of instruments fastened to the black dashboard
in front of the working pilot, Perk enjoyed
his little nightly repast as only a fellow with his
splendid appetite might.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he nudged Jack in the side, and offered
him a tempting ham sandwich the other shook his
head in the negative, as though he was quite too
busy to take advantage of the offer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Following this up he made gestures which Perk
interpreting understood him to signify he might alter
his mind later on, when the conditions had
changed a bit for the better. That was just like
Jack—he liked to eat, it was true, when hungry;
but never allowed a mutinous stomach to cause him
to take the slightest chance of neglecting his duty.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Perk had to dine all by himself; but he generously
kept one fair-sized sandwich for the time
when his chum would feel like having a few bites;
which might not be until he wished Perk to take
his place at the controls.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a dreary round they were making now—like
keeping time in the awkward squad in the
training camp—going through all the motions
without advancing the spark an atom—round and
round in that big circle, as the hours dragged along
on leaden feet, with Perk growing fairly wild
to end it all, even by accepting unusual risks.</p>

<p class='c011'>Five o’clock came at last, and Perk more than
once strained his eyes in staring hard toward the
east, hoping to be able to glimpse a faint sign of
approaching dawn—just a peep that would make
him feel better; but thus far all in vain.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nor was he able to detect any let-up in the
floating sea of murky fog—it hung about them
most persistently, almost dense enough to be felt;
indeed most of the time their faces were wet despite
the fact that they were shut up in the closed
cabin of their ship.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ev’rything must have an end,” Perk told himself
about this time; “an’ I kinder guess naow that
ole snap sayin’ must be so; anyway, here’s hopin’
afore long naow I’ll be squintin’ at the sun apeepin’
above the rim o’ the world over yonder in the—yeah,
it’s east, okay, the compass she tells it. Gettin’
sorter sleepy in the bargain; but shucks! nothin’
doin’ ’long that ere line till we’re outen the woods,
an’ on ground safe’n sound agin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Half-past five brought a little but welcome
change in the monotonous situation. Perk was
duly thrilled to discover what he believed to be a
dim gleam of light piercing the shrouded east,
which he fondly hoped was caused by the near
approach of the early dawn.</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not mention the welcome news to his ally,
fearing lest it prove to be a mere stretch of that
wonderful imagination of his, such as in times
past had so frequently played him the saddest of
tricks—no, it would really be wiser for him to bide
his time, and make sure he was not turning out to
be what he would call a “false alarm.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Despite his eager wish the faint light did not
appear to increase to any extent; although Perk
knew it must surely be about time for the dawn
to break, if it ever meant to dispel the miserable
pall of wet fog that had been like a blanket during
the whole night—saving the hour or so they spent
on the way before it gathered around them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If the tarnation thing gives me the merry ha!
ha! neow, after I’ve shook hands with myself, I’ll
feel like jumpin’ off, and tryin’ aout my ’chute,
that aint been aired for many a blue moon. But it
stands to reason there <i>must</i> be some sorter end to
ev’ry night; an’ I’ll hold on a bit longer. Gosh
amighty! what wouldn’t I give to feel jest a whiff
o’ wind caressin’ my cheek when I pokes my nose
outadoors—but no sech good fortune—we’re still
in the soup for keeps, Jack ’nd me, wuss luck!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Still it seemed as though his heart was set on
seeing that dim line grow wider, and bringing with
it fresh hopes of a change in the dull programme;
judging from the way Perk continued to stare toward
where he knew from the compass lay the
eastern heavens.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack flew on, apparently quite oblivious to the
wild yearnings that kept gnawing at the heart of
his comrade. Thus far he had reason to believe
they had continued on that circle, where fifty miles
of running would fetch them back again to about
where they had started to make a ring. He would
fight it out on that line if it kept them going all the
next day; but until they could see the ground, so
as to find their bearings from certain landmarks
expressly emphasized in the rude chart inherited
from the missing brother of the Service, it was
utterly useless to expect to get anywhere.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some little time afterwards Perk, thinking to
find out whether there could be a “whiff of fresh
air” stirring outside, thrust his head from the
partly open door, and sniffed eagerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>The result was highly satisfactory, for he instantly
discovered a most delightful thing—there
was not only the fresh cold air to be expected at
such a high altitude, possibly ten thousand feet
at the time; but, in addition there came across his
feverish face the sensation of a genuine <i>breeze</i>,
blowing, as he quickly found out, directly from the
south.</p>

<p class='c011'>He could not resist keeping his head protruding,
so as to make assurance doubly certain; and while
thus engaged he chanced to turn and look toward
the east again.</p>

<p class='c011'>Something caught his eyes, and held him riveted,
as if turned into a pillar of salt like Lot’s unfortunate,
disobedient wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hot-diggetty-dig! if that ere aint the mornin’
star I’ll eat my hat!” Perk told himself in great
excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was most thrilling news he carried back with
him when he ducked inside the cabin once more—news
he felt absolutely positive would break down
that icy reserve of his companion; and cause Jack
to join him in giving vent to expressions of jubilation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hey! c’n yeou beat it, partner?” he cried, as
soon as he could get to the ear of his boon companion;
and for the time being disdaining the help
of the ear-phones; then he paused for breath, having
in his excitement lost his grip, it appeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beat what?” roared the other, understanding
from Perk’s actions, together with the exultant
tone of his raised voice, that something out of the
common must have come about.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Breeze started up!” whooped Perk, gulping in
a supply of wind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bully boy!” Jack sent back at him, managing
to make himself understood above all the racket of
motor and propeller, which was some triumph,
since he did not possess the lung power that Perk
boasted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And—yeou c’n see the ole mornin’ star off in
the east, showin’ the dratted fog pack she’s a
liftin’ by hunks; so, as the dawn’s at hand we’ll be
okay!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c015'>CHAPTER XIII <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>All Thanks to Simeon</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Bully again!” Perk faintly heard his cool pal
call out, against the row their motor exhaust was
keeping up.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was considerable excitement in camp just
about that time, although to be sure Perk was
showing most of the same.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fog was in retreat after all those tantalizing
hours of holding the fort—there could no longer
be any doubt concerning this fact. He could even
see how it was being blown off toward the north
by increasing puffs of agitated air; and meanwhile
that line of pearly hue in the east was widening
by spasms, until faint touches of rosy light painted
the skyline as with the brush of a magician artist.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk had adjusted their useful ear-phones, for
he felt confident they would want to exchange congratulations,
in that the long and tedious night
had finally come to an end, with what promised
to become a “dandy” day opening up before them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack laughed to himself when he actually caught
his relieved brother pilot humming a fragment of
a little popular love-song they had been hearing
several times of late in the “talkies” they patronized
when in old San Diego; and which evidently
had been echoing in Perk’s brain ever since;
though if accused of “getting soft” the other
would most certainly have indignantly denied the
fact, and vowed he had never had a best girl—or
any species of girl—in his whole natural life.</p>

<p class='c011'>So things continued to brighten more and more,
with Perk straining his vision from time to time
in order to be the first to discover “land ahead,”—in
other words sight the far-distant earth below
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>It came at last, after he had thus stared as much
as half a dozen times; and he had the proud satisfaction
of informing his comrade of the interesting
fact. There was a vein of triumph in Perk’s
voice; one would easily think he must be a modern
Columbus announcing the discovery of a new
world; and yet it had only been one solitary night
since last they were in touch with their old friend
<i>terra firma</i>—solid ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just the same that had proven to be such a
memorable night, so filled with thrills, and accumulated
anxieties, so gloomy in the midst of the
greatest fog pack in history, that really Perk might
be excused for showing undue jubilation over this,
their ultimate deliverance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hully gee! partner!” he called out suddenly;
“I kin see it, that’s right; an’ say, she sure <i>does</i>
look good to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Meaning the earth, I reckon, eh, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nawthin’ less, buddy—fog’s a climbin’ aout
like hot cakes—soon wont be a single wisp left, I
take it. But gee! what a pictur’ it makes—never
did set my lamps on sech <i>turrible</i> stuff afore—looks
like Ole Nature had busted loose in tryin’ to
pile up rocks as big as skyscrapers in little Ole
New York, some o’ ’em as big as the highest hill
in the Catskills. What a place—what a place, I’d
say agin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Does look a bit rough,” admitted the noncommittal
Jack, after himself taking a swift survey.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A bit rough—huh! yeou jest can’t ekal it if
yeou trips all over this Rocky Mountain country
fur weeks, that’s a fact, Jack Ralston. Seems like
we was abeatin’ the record right along on this here
jaunt—the thickest fog—the longest night—an’
neow the beatenist country ever! If it keeps agoin’
like that we’re bound to run up against the wust
gang o’ holdup men that was ever heard of.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Had that idea in my mind from the start, so
it isn’t going to surprise me much if it comes true,”
Jack calmly informed him.</p>

<p class='c011'>About this time Perk discovered that the last
retreating phalanx of the late fog belt had passed
from his sight, dissolving in thin air as it seemed.
The early morning, as viewed from that great
altitude, was most charming indeed, with those
fleecy white cloudlets all around them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The speeding plane ducked in and out of the
groups as though playing the old childrens’ game
of tag, or else hide-and-seek. Perk himself likened
the picture to the gridiron, being especially fond
of football games as practiced along the Coastal
Slope around Thanksgiving time, and later on,
when the East was battling with its chilly blizzards—in
imagination he could readily picture
their ship to be the man who had the pigskin bag
held tightly under his arm, and kept darting this
way and that, eluding the outstretched hands of
would-be tacklers, and dodging all interference, on
his wild dash to make a much needed goal.</p>

<p class='c011'>It gave him a delightful thrill to thus compare
their passage with the one hero whom he most admired—the
prodigy to whom his favorite college
was indebted for their greatest victory, when defeat
had seemed so perilously near.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take over the stick, Perk; I reckon I’d feel
better if I stretched my arms and legs a bit,” the
wearied pilot now announced; to which the other
only too gladly acquiesced; for many times during
the last few hours he had hung over his mate, as
if trying to influence Jack to change places.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeah, an’ Jack, while yeou’re ’bout it jest
sample the grub—coffee’s fine an’ dandy, as well’s
steamin’ hot. Goes through yeou like ’lectricity in
this cold atmosphere.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“After I’ve had a good look through the glasses,
to see if there’s any sign of the targets Brother
Simeon marked down on his rough pigeon carrier
chart we’re depending on to see us through.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That was just like Jack—duty always before
pleasure. His empty stomach—the lovely view
Perk had been drinking in so eagerly—all such
trivial matters must wait until he had attended
to much more important ones.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk might have expected to hear him say what
he did, since from long experience he was fully
acquainted with his pal’s methods of carrying out
his business calls. Perk also knew quite well that
he could never claim to be such a Spartan, since
the “fleshpots of Egypt” usually tempted him to
take precedence, when it became a matter of choice
between them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Long and earnestly did Jack examine the ground
below. He had given Perk instructions to make
several long dips, each time flattening out again
on a level keel; and during all this time he was engaged
in staring through the magical lens that
brought far distant objects so close he could
even distinguish the character of the bark on
such trees as came under his observation.</p>

<p class='c011'>At such times as they were moving on the level
Perk managed to also scan the scene below them.
They had by now greatly reduced their distance
from the rugged landscape, being not more than
something like five thousand feet aloft; but stare
as he might Perk, even with his keen vision, was
unable to discover a single moving object—it was
as if they owned the whole world for the time being—a
weird sensation that rather awed imaginative
Perk.</p>

<p class='c011'>About this time the one at the controls saw his
companion keeping the glasses focussed on a certain
point, as though he might have discovered
something encouraging there—possibly an upstanding
object such as had been noted on that
invaluable if crude penciled map.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hot-diggetty-dig!” Perk muttered to himself,
as he felt his pulses quicken once more, “don’t I
jest hope he’s struck ile—run acrost some piled-up
crags that might a served Simeon as a good
marker. But great snakes! heow air we agoin’ to
drop daown anywhere when there aint nary a sign
o’ level ground as big as my red neckerchief; an’ us
a wantin’ a stretch a hundred feet, long—as much
more as we kin find?”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he tried to keep still while waiting to hear
anything of interest Jack might have to report.
Most certainly the other must have made some
sort of discovery, or believed he had at least; for
he continued to scrutinize that particular section
of the rocky ground just ahead in a way that
looked promising to his anxious partner.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finally Jack lowered the binoculars, with Perk
watching his face as if hoping to read good news
reflected there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No doubt about it, I’m glad to tell you, Perk,”
Jack was saying; and if there was a trifling vein of
relief in his voice one could hardly wonder at such
a thing, after their just passing such a wretched
night, and flying blind through the long hours,
with but faint prospects of striking their goal when
the coming of dawn allowed of an observation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hey! does that mean yeou got a squint o’
somethin’ worth while, partner?” cried Perk,
solicitously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just what it does,” the other assured him.
“Swing around in a circle, and I’ll let you have a
look for yourself, buddy.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c015'>CHAPTER XIV <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Closing the Gap</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Accordingly Perk swung off to the left, and
banked sharply, thus starting on a turn that if
pursued long enough would once more fetch them
to the point from whence they had started the maneuver.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now I’ll take hold again for a time, until
you’ve had your look,” announced Jack, suiting
the action to the word.</p>

<p class='c011'>While his mate manipulated the glasses Jack
coached him word by word, until Perk finally uttered
a cry of triumph.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I got it, partner, sure I have!” he was saying
in great gladness. “Can’t hardly b’lieve my eyes,
it sure seems like a reg’lar miracle—to think o’ all
we plugged through, an’ was able to hit straight
to the bullseye o’ aour target—it dazes me to
strike sech a wonderful happenin’, that’s right.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you recognize it from the brief description
he gave on the side of his tissue-paper chart,
do you, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It caint be anythin’ else, for a fack, buddy—there
couldn’t run two queer heaps o’ rocks that
look so much like a reg’lar ole-time castle on the
Rhine! Yep, we done aourselves proud this time—meanin’
<i>yeou</i> did, Jack, ahandling the stick so
smartly. Naow, what’s next on the programme,
tell me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’re to take hold once more, and keep circling
that target, while I stow away a little chow;
afterwards I’ll run things while you stoke up. We
must keep in mind that there’s no occasion for any
undue haste—we’re out to get results, no matter
how long we’ve got to hang around this part of the
country. Caution, and slow progress—those are to
be our watchwords, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I get yeou, partner,” was all that the other remarked,
as he once more laid down the binoculars,
and proceeded to take over the controls.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just the same Perk knew full well Jack was
intending to warn him against one of his faults,
that of starting off on some important mission
without due regard for precautions—a failing that
had cost Perk dear more than a few times in the
past, and which had never been fully eradicated
from his system, no matter how gallantly he tried.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now that the coast was clear, and he had made
the discovery calculated to prove so fortunate, as
well as useful, Jack could think of other matters
less important and yet really necessary.</p>

<p class='c011'>He got out their “bait-box,”—as Perk always
called the receptacle of their food supplies—and
proceeded to enjoy a ham-sandwich, washed down
with the hot coffee already sweetened, and with
genuine cream added; thanks to Perk’s “pull” with
that favorite waiter in the San Diego restaurant,
and whom he had mentally promised to reward
some fine day, in a way commensurate with the
service rendered.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack took his time.</p>

<p class='c011'>He always did when eating, and consequently
never knew those qualms along the line of indigestion,
which occasionally doubled poor, hasty Perk
up with such violence. Moreover, he seemed to
be enjoying his novel breakfast vastly, a fact that
tickled the other more or less, for Perk certainly
did enjoy seeing others happy.</p>

<p class='c011'>From time to time they exchanged words. Of
course their talk was wholly connected with the
serious business on which Uncle Sam had dispatched
them, and which they were now following
out as best they could.</p>

<p class='c011'>So early in the game it was of course wholly impossible
to lay their plans save vaguely; as they
picked up further information they could, as Perk
was fond of saying, “advance the spark,” and
build some sort of a structure calculated to bring
down the enemy’s fort in ruins, unless indeed, they
managed to turn the tables on the two sleuths.</p>

<p class='c011'>As they thus chatted at their ease while swinging
around in a succession of short circles, the
centre of which was always that conical heap of
jagged rocks Perk humorously called Castle Thunder,
the name of Simeon Balderson naturally came
up.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk had himself been doing more or less pondering
upon the unknown fate of the Secret Service
man, who was, so Jack had informed him, a
most valued agent of the Government.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I jest caint help awonderin’ what made him
fall daown on his job that a ways,” he mentioned
to his comrade; which of course was Perk’s method
of trying to draw the other out, so as to imbibe
Jack’s way of reasoning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That must, as I said before,” came the reply,
“remain a dead mystery to us unless we happen to
run across the answer while poking around. He
was up against a tough bunch, and if they discovered
what he was doing the chances are they’d
put him out of their way in the easiest possible
fashion—throwing him over some precipice, or
shooting him full of holes. That’ll come to us in
the bargain, I reckon, if we’re unlucky enough to
slip-up, and fall into their hands.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! I cal’late these kiotes jest hate all Government
men like a cat does agettin’ its feet wet,”
hazarded Perk, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh worse, far worse than that, buddy,” Jack
assured him amiably; “they know how their lives
are at stake, and to them a Secret Service man
takes on the shape of a noose, or the electric chair.
Whenever it comes to a fight between the two of
us, and that crowd, it’s got to be to the death, with
no mercy shown.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I savvy, partner,” Perk told him, firmly;
“knowed that much right along. Doant skeer me
any, either, ’cause my life’s been made up o’ takin’
chances—over in France in that ole sausage balloon
company—then in circus stunts in a ricketty
airship that <i>was</i> always agoin’ to blow up with
us—after that servin’ with the Canadian Mounties
up in the Northwest Territory, like yeou know
’bout; and last but not least, the times I been with
yeou ascootin’ raound the hull country, ahaulin’
in smugglers, bootleggers, flim-flam artists, bogus
money-makers, check raisers, an’ sech nasty fry.
I jest dote on runnin’ close chances—it’s sure the
life that suits Gabe Perkiser.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The first job we’re going to tackle is along the
line of making a safe and sane landing—you get
that of course, Perk?” continued practical Jack.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nawthin’ else, partner,” answered the other,
without hesitation; “seems like ever’thing depends
on that same. But aint it like lookin’ fur a needle
in a haystack to reckon on findin’ that ere one
little patch o’ level ground he wrote was the on’y
place where a ship could come daown, an’ not
crash?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m going to correct you there, brother,” Jack
was saying; “there is yet another landing field,
and even a much better one; but out of our reach,
for according to Simeon it lies <i>inside</i> the Hole-in-the-Wall
valley where these fugitives from the
Law have their hangout. He even so much as
hinted that they had some kind of a plane themselves,
which was in frequent use between this
section of country, and certain cities where they
had secret connections, and started much of their
counterfeit stuff into circulation, to the mystification
of the authorities, who could never seem to
pick up their trail.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jest so, Jack, ole hoss, the air doant ever leave
a trail, which makes it right hard fur such fellers
as us to get agoin’ straight. Ready to start on aour
way, be yeou, partner?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but I want you to keep on using the
glasses right along,” Jack told him. “If we had the
misfortune to overlap that single open patch of
ground, we’d be all at sea, and must double back,
so as to go over the ground again, which would
increase the chances of our being discovered, or
heard by some of the outlaws possibly out hunting,
or going to and fro.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll do my level best to hit on the mark, Jack;
jest go as slow as yeou kin, so’s to gimme every
chance to count. Haow far ’bout do yeou figger
goin’ on this tack, I want to know?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, this target we’ve struck he said on his
paper map was something like twenty miles
away from the entrance to the hidden valley—you
remember that of course, Perk? The landing field,
as we’ve got to call it from now on, would be some
six or seven miles away from their Haunt; and
consequently I expect to cover twelve miles, more
or less, before I’m looking to have you tell me you’ve
sighted our goal. If ever you used those sharp
eyes of yours to advantage, now’s the time for an
extra effort, partner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leave it to me, boy; I aint agoin’ to fail yeou,
not if I have to stare my ole peepers aout o’ focus
for keeps. Drop daown some ways, Jack—less
chance o’ aour bein’ seen; an’ it’s goin’ to help me a
heap in hittin’ that bit o’ level stretch. Cuckoo!
that’s the ticket—we’re droppin’ like a rocket-stick
after she’s shot her bolt. Naow for to get
my eagle eyes daown to business.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c015'>CHAPTER XV <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>A Clever Landing</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A brief time passed, and then Perk called out
excitedly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say, I kinder b’lieve I kin glimpse thet same
pesky hangaout—looks like some sorter mounting
pass, sech as he drawed in his map, where they
went in an’ kim aout; but they’s a kinder haze
ahangin’ over yonder that makes it hard to
be dead sure. If we get it araoun’ here it’ll hide us
from bein’ seen. The wind up here’s hittin’ us in
the face, too, which helps some in the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind about the hideout—that’ll all come
later on. Just now it’s that landing-field we need
most of all—keep your glass on the ground just
ahead, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ten seconds later the observer uttered a sudden
exclamation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Get a bite?” demanded Jack, just about ready
to swing around, as it seemed taking too hazardous
chances to continue their advance any further.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Kinder guess I sure have,” Perk told him; and
then proceeded to direct the eyes of the pilot on a
certain spot over which the ship was then passing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You struck it that time, buddy!” exclaimed
Jack, evidently mightily relieved in his mind; for
a crisis was upon them, with a change in their
movements absolutely essential, unless they meant
to give the whole scheme away, and wreck their
plan of campaign, which was not to be considered
at all.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeah,” Perk went on to add, more confidently
than before; “that’s it, for a certain<i>tee</i>—the on’y
place where a ship kin drop with a ghost o’ a show
to keep from bein’ smashed to flinders. Goin’
doawn, are yeou, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no need for the other to make answer,
since already the big Fokker tri-motored
ship was dropping steadily. How fortunate for
them that just at that critical moment Nature herself
was working overtime in their favor—the
wind veering until it came directly in their faces;
while that little haze acted as a veil to conceal them
from the hidden valley lookout—if indeed any
such happened to be posted, to give warning should
danger menace the fugitive gangsters.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk waited, and watched, his tense face betraying
the natural anxiety he must just then be enduring.
It was indeed no small danger that faced them,
for only a most skillful pilot would be able to successfully
land a great airship on such a precarious
and scanty stretch of fairly level ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>A very small thing that could hardly be avoided,
save through a near miracle, would suffice to throw
the heavy plane off balance, and bring about a
wreck that must interfere greatly with their mission,
if not utterly ruin every hope of success.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes, Perk could easily be excused for feeling
a tenseness around the region of his staunch
heart—a tightening of the nerves and sinews—a
halt in his free breathing, all of them occurring
simultaneously; for the most sanguine of watchers
would have easily said the feat was beyond
human capacity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet there was Jack going about the job with
apparently the same <i>sang froid</i> that it was his custom
to show when coming down from the clouds,
to settle upon the almost perfect landing green of
the big San Diego airport.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say, what <i>wouldn’t</i> I give right naow if on’y
I could ketch that confident spirit my best pal’s
got mixed up in his mind an’ heart?” So Perk was
telling himself as he saw the deftness of the touch
shown by the hand at the controls, as well as the
wonderful response the perfect mechanism aboard
the Fokker displayed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now Jack held her head on, with the ground almost
within reach—beyond, the narrow stretch
extended just about a hundred feet; and in this
space he must bring his charge up with a round
turn; for should the ship keep on she would assuredly
be wrecked beyond repair.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tail came in contact, and bounded up again,
to immediately repeat the manœuvre; the wheels
gliding roughly along, with the body of the ship
bouncing from side to side, after the usual custom
when the landing is at all inclined to be a bit off-color.</p>

<p class='c011'>The motors had ceased working, and the spinning
propeller had in consequence commenced to
whirl less violently. Perk allowed himself to suck
in his first good breath in a score of seconds.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Glory be!” he was saying to himself, lost in
admiration and sheer wonder—“dang my hide if
he ain’t agoin’ to make it, I do declare—did yeou
ever in yeour born days see the like o’ that—bet
there aint another pilot west o’ the Mississip could
a done it that smart—hot-diggetty-dig! we’re
astoppin’, as sure as anything we air. Wow!”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the big plane ceased to move forward and
came to a stand less than five feet from the terminus
of the smooth ground, Perk, utterly overcome,
lay back inert, “weak as a cat,” as he himself
afterwards described his condition.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And that’s that!” was all Jack allowed himself
to comment; just as he might have said in the days
when he was a barnstormer, and ’chute leaper at
County Fair gatherings—after sailing down from
a five-thousand foot ceiling, clinging to his decrepit
parachute, and making a soft landing in
some ploughed field.</p>

<p class='c011'>They both sat there as if to recover their breath.</p>

<p class='c011'>No longer did the roar of the exhaust break
upon their hearing—all was marvelously still
round about them—the rocks reared their crests
high above their heads, and looking more cruel
and pitiless than when seen at a distance. Perk
shuddered as he noted the innumerable projections
that stuck out almost like giant needles in a cushion,
any one of which, had its point come in contact
with the now stranded ship, must have played
havoc with its structure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! wake me up somebody, wont yeou
kindly?” Perk finally broke out, as if possessed by
the idea he must have been dreaming such a descent
could be put through successfully. “There
sure never was sech a crackin’ good drop as the
one yeou jest made, Pal Jack—I hand yeou the
palm for luck an’ skill combined; an’ I hopes as
heow I have yeou fur my side kick as long as I’m
in this here flyin’ trick!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack turned a beaming face on him at hearing
this fulsome compliment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nice of you to say what you did, Perk, old
chum;” he remarked, with a nod of his head; “but
you greatly overrate the landing—all any one had
to do was to pick out the safest way, and stick to
it through thick and thin. Easy as falling off a log,
let me tell you, buddy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! yeah; <i>but yeou stuck</i>!” Perk thrust back,
as though after all that clinched the whole matter,
which it undoubtedly did.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Next thing we’ve got to do, Perk, is to check
up, so as to find out whether the ship was injured
any by contact with rocks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Right yeou are there, partner,” the other
chimed in, quickly; “but I kinder guess as haow
we aint got much to worry over that-a-ways, ’cause
she kim daown so easy like, it wouldn’t hardly
abroken an egg.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The proof of the pudding is always in the
eating,” wary Jack told him; “and we know one
of the weakest parts of a ship lies in the undergear.
Let’s get a move on, and find out what’s
what.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Accordingly they both started to look things
over, backed by a host of past similar checkings.
It could be only a superficial examination; but just
the same the result pleased them immeasurably,
for never the least damage could they hit upon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk was almost delirious with joy, and wonder
as well.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never would a b’lieved that stunt could be
pulled off if I hadn’t seen the miracle carried aout
with my own lamps,” he kept saying half to himself,
as he finished his part of the survey. “Jest
won-der-ful, I’d call it, an’ let her go at that, which
doant tell half the story.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack, having had the severe strain removed
from his mind, now consented to finish his breakfast,
the natural hunger of a healthy young chap
asserting its prerogative. Accordingly, since Perk
also confessed to feeling a “bit peckish” they sat
down on the ground, with the coffee container between
them, and a heap of the “ham-an’ sandwiches”
which had come from their favorite restaurant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As soon as we get through this necessary business,
Perk, we’ll stow some of the grub that’s left
over in our pockets for an emergency. After that
we’ll pick out such traps as we may need in our
game, and trot along—though judging from the
looks of this same ravine it’ll be only a figure of
speech, because we’ll find it necessary to crawl like
a couple of snails most of the way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeah! that sounds more like it, buddy,” agreed
Perk, eying the depression with a scowl, as
though he hardly liked the nature of the job ahead.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c015'>CHAPTER XVI <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Up Against a Silver-tip</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>There was some difficulty when it came to selecting
such things as might prove most handy in
their difficult task. Several had to be laid aside as
being too bulky and cumbersome; for weight
would count heavily against them in forcing a passage
through the thick growth in the ravine; as
well as later when they struck the mighty upheaval
of rocks on the side of the mountain, below the
natural pass into the Hole-in-the-Wall valley.</p>

<p class='c011'>Those things they had selected were divided up,
and made into two packages of about equal weight.
When Jack did not happen to be looking Perk
managed to slip several articles into his pack, evidently
begrudging their lack; which he considered
only right and proper, since his shoulders and
back must stand for the extra strain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ if we do need ’em, which is like enough,”
he told himself, as if in apology for his deceit;
“they might jest prove <i>life-savers</i>—yeou never
kin tell haow the cat’s agoin’ to jump; an’ they do
say as a stitch in time saves yeour whole bacon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Having attached these bundles securely to their
backs the pair were ready to start forth on their
perilous errand—matching their wits and courage
against the lawless spirits who had defied the
power of Uncle Sam, believing it would take the
whole U. S. army to dislodge them from such an
isolated and natural fortress.</p>

<p class='c011'>“First thing we’ve got to remember, partner,”
said Jack, softly, as they began to plunge into the
wild growth that filled the deep ravine from one
side to the other, “is to get our bearings as we
advance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gosh amighty! Jack, is that a go, when all we
got to ’member is haow we kept aheadin’ ’long this
ere coulie. I doant see haow anybody could go
astray in sech a canyon as this same.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To be sure,” Jack assured him, “that’s true as
long as this is the only old waterbed we’ll have to
follow; which it isn’t, if you remember those directions
Simeon sent in. Once we became a bit
rattled as to which channel to follow, and it’d ruin
all our calculations—the element of uncertainty
has wrecked more clever plans than anything agoing.
More than that, we must turn around and
stare at the way things look from the other direction;
because we’ll be heading back to our camp
when we need to follow our trail. You know lots
of landmarks may seem okay in going, which you’d
never recognize when coming from the opposite
quarter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeah! I knowed that too, buddy,” affirmed
Perk, with a grin; “read ’baout the same lots o’
times as a kid, when I used to soak in stories o’
them old days in Kentucky, that they called the
Dark an’ Bloody Ground——Daniel Boone, Simon
Kenton, Harrod an’ them forest rangers picked
that trick up from the Shawnee Injuns they used to
fight. We’ll face the other way heaps o’ times, an’
make picters o’ the scenery on aour minds; that’s
okay with me, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For some little time they had all they could do
to push their way along, so matted were the vines
and the underbrush, so extremely rough the footing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Twice Perk had stumbled, and come near having
an ugly fall; he even managed to skin his right
knee painfully by coming in contact with a rock;
but never a grunt did he emit, accustomed as he
was to taking such things as part of the game.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mebbe naow this is what I get fur loadin’ me
daown so heavy,” he told himself, under his
breath; “but jest the same I aint ameanin’ to throw
a single thing away; ’cause that’d sure turn aout
to be jest what we needed most to save our skins.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Later on, as they stood still and rested a bit, Perk
again confided in his companion; he always did
seem to suck more or less consolation out of these
frequent “chinnings,” as they afforded him
opportunities to see things through Jack’s eyes, an
advantage Perk greatly appreciated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“More I get thinkin’ ’baout the slick way that
same Simeon took a carrier pigeon ’long with him,
so he could be sure o’ gettin’ valuable information
into the hands o’ his boss, the more I admire the
ole gink. I knowed as haow the French used them
birds over across the water, when we was afightin’
the Heinies; but say, tryin’ sech a game aout in
the Secret Service was a new dodge on me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Both clever, and original, Perk,” assented the
other, fastening on his pack once more; “but then,
as I remember Simeon Balderson he was always
different from the common truck of the Force. I’ll
be right sorry if anything has happened to him—wiped
out by these devils up here, just because
they naturally hate all Service men.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus they continued to stumble along, sometimes
one in the lead, and then later on the other
would forge ahead, just as circumstances brought
things about.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no attempt to make any kind of
speed, since time did not count in what they were
trying to accomplish—far better to spend a week,
even two, than to ruin everything by some incautious
move.</p>

<p class='c011'>From time to time sounds would come to their
ears, mostly ahead; but in every case these could
be set down as proceeding from birds, or small
animals that may have discovered their approach,
and were showing signs of restlessness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once, however, a faint report drifted to their
ears through some slant in the breeze, being possibly
a mile or more distant, which both recognized
as a gunshot—the only evidence of human beings
that thus far they had discovered.</p>

<p class='c011'>It acted as a spur, making them remember what
they were up against; but Perk only smiled, as
though he cared very little how soon they ran
into the jaws of trouble, and matched their talents
against those they sought.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then they had a severe shock—it came almost
without the least warning too, which made it more
stunning.</p>

<p class='c011'>A rustling in the underbrush—what sounded
like a snarl or a grunt; and as they flashed a startled
look in that direction, a huge shaggy figure
uprose to betray the presence of a genuine Rocky
Mountain grizzly of un-heard-of proportions,
standing erect.</p>

<p class='c011'>To make the matter all the more serious the
frightful beast was almost directly in their way,
blocking any further movement along the ravine.
Besides, while they carried arms, it was highly
imprudent on several accounts for them to dream
of using the same.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the first place their automatics would seem
but trivial instruments when used against such a
monster, said to have the nine lives of a cat; and
often known to still be in fighting trim after receiving
a volley of lead from powerful modern
sporting rifles.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then again if they were forced to fire, even
though lucky enough to down their hairy enemy,
the sound of the discharges was certain to be
heard by those in hiding, and would serve to turn
the entire settlement out searching for the cause
of the rattling sounds.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hot-diggetty-dig! did yeou <i>ever</i> see sech a buster
o’ a bar?” Perk was gasping, as he stared
aghast; “an’ the tarnel beast’s startin’ to move
this way, as sure as shootin’, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’ve just got to clear out!” came the ultimatum
from Jack.</p>

<p class='c011'>That was easy to say, but what chance would
they have against such a powerful beast, evidently
with some reason to hate all two-legged bipeds,
having possibly at some time in the past been
severely wounded by such a creature, and holding
a vendetta against all the clan. He could break
through the worst tangle with ease, while they
must be held up, and their progress impeded frightfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack hit a brilliant idea almost on the instant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Follow me, Perk!” he shrilled, tersely; “we’ve
got to climb a tree! Let’s go, partner!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Which tree?” Perk demanded, as he kept close
at the other’s heels.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Over this way—got limbs low down—silver-tips
can’t climb a tree, I’ve heard. Hurry—hurry!”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was indeed need of haste, for they could
distinctly hear the smashing advance of the big
brute; also catch the growling as he pursued the
fleeing pair who had dared invade his private
hunting patch.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neither of them dared cast a single look back,
lest they stumble over an outcropping rock, or get
entangled in some running vine, such as fairly
covered the ground in certain places, to serve as
traps to incautious feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack managed to arrive at the selected tree
ahead of his mate, and swinging around to the further
side, so as to keep out of the other’s way,
commenced to lift himself into the lower branches.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was no slight task, seeing how heavily
they were both loaded down with those bundles
fastened to their backs; but it is wonderful what
fright can accomplish under similar conditions;
and Perk was already pawing at the other side of
the friendly tree, wild with eagerness to hoist himself
far enough from the ground so as to avoid
contact with those cruel claws of the monster, of
which he had doubtless heard thrilling stories
concerning their length, and sharpness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nearer came the crashing sounds, and the
growls; but by great good luck the angry beast
arrived just too late to attain his end; for while
he reached up all of ten feet Perk believed, he
could not more than barely touch the lower foot
of the climber, which was instantly drawn beyond
his reach.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a full minute, more or less, neither of them
could spare the breath to make any sort of comment
over their narrow escape—it was enough
for them to know they had nothing to fear immediately
from the irate silver-tip, still standing
erect, and emitting those hoarse growls, as if to
tell them what he would do if only they ventured
within his reach.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Perk made a slight move, and Jack feared
he might be about to kick at the beast’s elevated
snout, which would only irritate Bruin a great
deal more.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Keep quiet, and don’t do anything to stir him
up more than he is already,” was the way Jack
cautioned his running mate, knowing the impulsive
nature of Perk only too well. “He may fade
away when he sees he can’t touch us. Just get your
breath back, Pal Perk, and wait up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Okay, brother,” replied the other, as though
recognizing the soundness of his comrade’s doctrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>But somehow or other the big beast showed no
signs of intending to break the siege by “fading
out,” as Jack had termed it; he continued to move
around the base of the tree, now on all fours, and
again raising up to his full height with ferocious
growls if either of them so much as made a slight
move.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gee whiz! he sure is some wheeze, I’d say,
Jack,” Perk remarked, after some little time had
passed, with no change whatever taking place.
“What if the ole geezer takes a notion to tent aout
here at aour tree—say, that’d be the limit, bet
yeour boots it would!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he fell silent for a spell, as though mentally
calculating the extent of such a calamity on their
fortunes.</p>

<p class='c011'>A full half hour must have passed without any
noticeable change in the conditions. The obstinate
beast stayed close to the foot of the tree, never
making any attempt at climbing the same; just as
though he might be well aware of his own shortcomings.</p>

<p class='c011'>A number of times, when one of the prisoners
among the branches chanced to make some sort of
movement, in order to relieve the numbness that
had gripped his legs, the bear would exhibit the
same ferocity he had shown all through the siege.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The old chap certainly must have a long debt
to pay toward somebody, and is taking it out on us,
Perk,” ventured Jack, breaking the silence once
more.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But it doant seem so much like a joke as at
first,” grumbled Perk, disconsolately. “What in
thunder’d we do if he camped aout on us, mebbe
fur a hull day’nd night—gorry! wouldn’t we be in
a pickle, though—nawthin’ to eat’r drink it might
be, an’ so sore in aour bodies we’d feel like howlin’.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! let’s hope it doesn’t turn out so serious as
all that,” Jack soothed him somewhat by saying
confidently. “What bothers me most is how we’re
going to do any sort of business, with that chap
hanging out in this neighborhood, and likely to
drop in on us any old minute.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drat the luck, any way!” growled the greatly
annoyed Perk, aghast at the very idea of slow
starvation; with that fat old husky camped at the
foot of their tree refuge, daring them to set a foot
on the ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>The morning was wearing away by degrees,
with the sun already peeping down into the deep
ravine, from its more lofty position in the heavens.
Perk was now busily engaged cudgeling his brains
in the endeavor to conjure up some species of
scheme by which they might have a chance to rid
themselves of their four-footed jailor.</p>

<p class='c011'>All at once Jack saw the other start to feeling
of his person eagerly as though some dazzling idea
had burst upon his mind. As a rule these occasions
were few and far between, and yet Perk had been
actually known to originate some amazing
schemes, that perhaps did not always turn out as
successfully as he himself might have fancied
would be the case.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I could a sworn I fetched it along, thinkin’
there might be some pesky rattlers in this here
coulie,” Jack heard him muttering; and then an
exclamation of delight announced that whatever
he had in mind it had eventually turned up in one
of his numerous pockets.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hey! what’s in the wind now, I want to
know?” Jack demanded, in idle curiosity, since he
hardly anticipated that his chum would be able to
offer any plausable plan for ridding themselves of
that intolerable nuisance encamped below decks.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk was holding something up exultantly, and
Jack could see it appeared to be a small <i>flask</i>—such
things were very common nowadays, with
prohibition in the land; but as he had never known
his mate to use strong spirits Jack naturally felt
more or less surprise to see such a bottle stowed
away on Perk’s person. But the word “rattlers”
may have given Jack a slight inkling of what it
all meant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fetched this here stuff ’long, Jack, in case
either o’ us ran afoul o’ a pizen snake,” came the
explanation; “kinder do hate to waste the same on
sech a wretched beast; but seems like it might get
us outen this nasty scrape.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack was forced to laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quite an original joke you’d play on Old Eph,
I take it, partner—get the poor stick drunk, you
mean, of course; but what makes you reckon he’d
take to the bottle; for of course you couldn’t lean
down far enough to pour the stuff into his open
mouth—that’d be a heap too dangerous, I’d think.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk gave him a reproachful look as he hastened
to explain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say, I aint <i>quite</i> that silly, I hopes, Jack ole
hoss, as to give that critter half a chanct to nab
me. I got another idee, it happens, such as ought
to pan aout too, if I kin do what I want without
spillin’ the beans, or in this case the bootleg stuff.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sounds good to me, Perk,” Jack told him as if
to encourage further explanations. “If you don’t
expect him to swallow it what then, partner?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jest yeou watch yeour Uncle Perk get busy,
boy, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Long before this both of them had relieved their
aching shoulders of the weighty packs they were
carrying, attaching the same safely to certain
broken limbs of the tree that came in conveniently
enough. This allowed of a certain amount of freedom;
and so Perk was able to wriggle down
several feet, his movements as usual attracting the
observation of the jealous guardian, for the great
shaggy beast stood upright, with his snout elevated
menacingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Be careful now, and don’t give him half an
opening to nab your foot, brother,” warned Jack.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shucks! he aint got a Chinaman’s chanct to do
that same, Jack. Hey! ole boy, do yeou smell it
a’ready, to be makin’ sech faces at me? Well, here
goes to wet yeou daown nice an’ easy like.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With that Perk leaned over still more—his hand
holding the pocket flask was just a foot or so above
the extended snout of the bear, when the first
trickle of the liquor started to fall, striking the
animal’s nose, and running down on the heavy
hair covering his neck and back.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Glory be! look at the scamp openin’ his mouth
and puttin’ aout his red tongue to ketch some o’
the drops!” cried the excited Perk. “Hey! don’t be
so het up an’ greedy, Mister; I sure aint atryin’
to get yeou soaked—seems like he’s quite took to
the bottle, don’t it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Like an old toper, for a fact, brother,” the
other assured him, laughing as he spoke. “I’ve
heard how the young black bears over in Yellowstone
Park come up to tourists, and beg for some
spirits, to which their taste turns; but I didn’t
know a big old tramp like this had a leaning that
way. I see you’re trying to keep him from swilling
it down, Perk; must have some object in letting
the stuff run all over his back as you’re doing?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Kinder think I have got sech a neat little
scheme, partner; on’y yeou wait up till I put the
finishin’ touch to the game—proof o’ the puddin’s
in the eatin’ o’ the same, yeou know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m waiting to be shown, buddy—you know
your hand, and can play it best. Go to it then, and
I’ll be the judge to say if it pans out okay or not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk was now draining the flask of the last
drop; for when he made up his mind to do a thing
he always went the limit.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, that finishes my snake-bite cure, more
the pity,” he kept telling his fellow prisoner, with
a vein of keen regret in his voice. “No, yeou jest
caint have another drop yeou greedy rascal. Seems
like yeou made things warm enuff for two ginks
what never did any harm to yeou or the fambly;
an’ now suh, the tables got to turn—I’m figgerin’
on makin’ the likes o’ yeou as hot as Tophet, that’s
right, Old Eph.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Still holding out the empty flask as though to
keep the bear from dropping down on all-fours,
Perk carefully took out a match, and held it poised
between fingers and thumb. Then it was that what
he really meant to do clicked in the mind of Jack;
it rather staggered him in the bargain, so that he
uttered an exclamation that told the other he had
divined his secret.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Kinder guess yeou’re on to my curves, buddy,”
observed Perk; “well, here she goes, an’ hopin’
luck comes aour way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He thereupon scraped the head of the match
along a certain part of the tree trunk—several
times was this repeated, but all to no avail, as the
friction did not appear to be brisk enough to start
things going.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Perk went back to first principles, and
gave a quick scrape down the seat of his trousers;
whereupon there followed a tiny flash, and the
match began to burn brightly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Waving the bottle, and letting a drop or two
ooze from its mouth Perk, watching his opportunity
cast the burning match directly on top of the
bear’s shaggy neck. He must have held his breath
with suspense while so doing, for he felt as though
he were casting the die, with everything at stake.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wow! it’s a go, Perk, you wonderful schemer!”
burst from Jack, as he saw a blue flame start up,
where the booze had fallen on the thick, rusty looking
coat of the astonished animal, instantly increasing
as the liquor caught.</p>

<p class='c011'>Both of them watched with staring eyes to see
what followed; but they did not have long to wait.
The bear dropped down on all four feet, and twisting
his head around commenced snapping viciously
at the spot where he already began to feel uncomfortably
warm. This caused him to burn his
tongue, and from that moment it took on all the
aspect of a <i>circus</i> to the two spectators lodged
there amidst the branches of that friendly tree; although
to be sure it was an altogether different
kind of situation to the astonished bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>The animal developed a surprising amount of
agility, twisting and turning in a frantic endeavor
to bite at the object that was giving him such a
queer sensation as of pain. But all his antics had
no effect on the fire in his coat, which was continually
extending its circulation by streaks and
bounds.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go to it, buddy—call aout the hull fire department
an’ smother the blaze, or yeou’re sure a goner.
Lookit him arollin’ on the ground to beat the band—aint
that cute though, partner—jest like sensible
human bein’s would do if they had their heads
’bout ’em when on fire. But it aint agoin’ to help
the pore ole dick any, either. There, he’s a runnin’
off like fun, headin’ fur some sorter water-hole he
knows ’bout, I kinder guess. What a sight that is,
Jack ole geezer; but jest the same I’m sorry ’bout
that snake pizen stuff, I sure am—didn’t canc’late
to have to use it on sech game.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s all right, Perk; it’d saved the cause, and
possibly our lives in the bargain. I’d call it well
spent, if you asked me,” Jack told him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say, look at him goin’ licketty split, like the Ole
Nick was after him, blazin’, an’ with spurts o’
smoke bustin’ outen his singed hide. He sure
enough played outen his class that time, I figger.
Mebbe, naow, he’ll cut an’ run next time he meets
gentlemen o’ aour stripe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The spectacle was so extremely ludicrous to
Perk that he writhed and twisted about as if
seized with a fit; so, too, did he threaten to burst
out into loud laughter only that Jack gave him due
warning of what dire consequences would be apt
to follow any indiscretion along those lines, which
sobered the hilarious one, and brought him back
to sanity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Kin we climb daown outen this tree naow,
partner?” asked Perk, after he could no longer
discern any further sign of the badly singed king
of the mountain valleys; “I’ll be tickled pink to be
able to stretch my legs a bit, seein’ they’re so stiff
an’ sore; but it shore was too bad ’bout losin’ my
precious snake pizen cure—hopes we aint a goin’
to need it any time, that’s all.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch18' class='c015'>CHAPTER XVIII <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>The Circling Buzzards</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Jack seemed nothing loth to carry out his chum’s
suggestion. Truth to tell he himself felt considerably
“cramped” in the lower part of his anatomy—any
one who has been compelled to camp amidst
the branches of a tree for a period of successive
hours, knows the experience is anything but a
pleasant one.</p>

<p class='c011'>So they slipped down, and once more stood on
solid ground, with Perk casting suspicious looks
in the quarter where last they had glimpsed the
fleeing grizzly, with jets of mingled smoke and fire
spitting this way and that.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! here’s hopin’ he’s went for good,” he
was saying, meaningly. “Let’s get a move on,
partner, an’ vacate these premises pronto—smells
too rank fur me jest naow—burnt hair allers <i>did</i>
get my goat, ever since that barber coaxed me to
have my crop singed—said as haow it’d grow out
agin a heap faster if the split ends they was
scotched away; but for a whole week afterwards
folks used to look at me funny like, an’ move further
away. Huh!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No hurry at all, buddy,” Jack told him; “that
live wire isn’t going to come back this way in a
hurry, you can depend on that. Let’s take a look,
and make sure nothing has been dropped from our
packs, or pockets. On the whole we’ve got a heap
to congratulate ourselves on, coming out of such
a scrape as well as we did—thanks to that bright
thought of yours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gee! it’s real nice o’ yeou to say that, Jack,
ole bean; I’m not sorry we had sech a queer experience;
on’y I do begrudge him that real stuff,
which is gone for keeps—it wasn’t moonshine, or
bootleg either, boy; but worth it’s weight in solid
silver—the man says as sold it to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, it did come in handy, for a fact, Perk,
and we mustn’t grieve over using it. Just try to
imagine one of us <i>did</i> get struck by the fangs of
a rattler, and the stuff saved a human life—in this
case maybe two. Cheer up—plenty more where
that came from, if only you’ve got the coin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Right yeou are, brother,” Perk thereupon
hastened to say, as he adjusted his pack to conform
with the angles of his body. “On’y I got to be
doubly keerful from neow on bout runnin’ smack
up again a pizenous viper, since it’d be jest too
bad to get struck, an’ no cure handy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When Perk had anything bothering him he was
in the habit of keeping his “misery” constantly on
tap; but then Jack was used to such little eccentricities
on the part of his bosom chum—Perk’s
good qualities more than compensated for his poor
ones, a fact which those who knew him realized.</p>

<p class='c011'>They started on, following the devious windings
of the former watercourse, where ages back
there must have been terrible floods rush down toward
the lowland, after every cloudburst at the top
of the mountains. Many years must have passed
since those happenings ceased, for the trees and
heavy undergrowth rooted in cracks of the mighty
rocks told this story of change.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I sure do hope we doant run into any other
kind o’ wild critter, while makin’ this grand sneak,”
Perk was telling himself, as he kept close behind
his leader, picking his steps as daintily as any high
born lady—since that was his method of keeping
watch for suspicious moving objects on the ground,
such as might turn out to be reptiles waiting to
puncture his ankles. “If I was totin’ my Winchester
along, an’ met up with a snarlin’ mounting
lion, I’d think it a bit o’ luck; but when yeour hands
are tied, so yeou dassent shoot a gun, things look
kinder different, that’s right, an’ not so good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Whenever Jack paused for a brief stop, and
stared back, Perk dutifully copied his action, trying
to impress certain local features of the landscape
upon his memory.</p>

<p class='c011'>They had by this time come a considerable distance
away from the spot where the airship had
been abandoned, partly screened by the overhanging
branches of several trees, and also a partial
blanket of evergreens, small ones they had been
able to tear up, and use with rare judgment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Part of the time it was possible for them to raise
their eyes and see the clear blue sky in places. Once
Perk discovered a moving object pass before his
vision, which he speedily made out to be a buzzard.
A second followed close behind, and then numerous
other of the carrion eaters, all swinging in the
same direction after the manner of their clan.</p>

<p class='c011'>As his eyes followed the circle of soaring birds
Perk had an unpleasant thought strike in that gave
him a chill around the region of his heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hot-diggetty-dig! I wonder neow could it be
them gluttonus birds they been pickin’ the bones
o’ thet poor Simeon what disappeared ’raound this
section o’ kentry? Jack hinted like he kinder
guessed the plug uglies had knocked him on the
head, an’ tossed his body over some big precipice.
Gee whiz! it shore does gimme a bad feelin’ to
think thataways, ’specially since chances air we
might be headin’ straight along that same road
aourselves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>After that there seemed to be some sort of a
horrible fascination about the wheeling line of
feathered scavengers, so that at every opportunity,
when an opening presented itself, Perk just stared,
and stared, frequently stumbling awkwardly over
an unnoticed object, and almost losing his balance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack noticed this fact presently, and felt called
upon to warn the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Keep your eyes more on the ground, partner,
and do less sky gazing,” he told Perk in a low but
distinct tone. “A tumble might give you a bad hurt;
and besides, we can’t afford to make any sort of
racket, you know. Never mind those rotten buzzards—what
do <i>we</i> care about their carrying-on.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk suspected that Jack had himself guessed
what ailed him, from the way he connected the
sailing of the uncanny crew with his companion’s
erratic actions. At any rate it rather abashed Perk
to realize his weakness could be so readily observed;
so he braced himself up, and tried to give a
low laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s okay, Jack; I’ll be a heap more keerful.
We got to do this grand creep as slick as grease,
with them pesky kiotes keepin’ their ears to the
ground for s’picious noises.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the subject of Simeon’s possible raw deal
had fastened itself on his mind, Perk continued to
speculate regarding the personality of the missing
Secret Service agent. The subject grew more interesting
the further he went, and in the end he
even asked Jack a question that was bothering him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeou says as haow yeou knowed this guy
Simeon some, didn’t yeou, partner?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I only met him a few times about a year back
while in Washington; but at that took quite a shine
to him,” Jack explained, as Perk nudged up against
him, both having stopped to rest after negotiating
an extra difficult stretch on their climb.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He must a been a fair good chap then, I guess,
partner, eh, what?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I liked him,” Jack added, concisely; “and they
thought well of him in the Big Chief’s offices.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Any fambly as yeou heard of?” Perk further
wished to know.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He told me he was a widower—I thought he
must be up against some sort of mind trouble—it
just impressed me that way, though he never let
out a word of his personal affairs; but I never saw
him smile, even when others in the party were
cracking jokes, and laughing their loudest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! too bad sech a fine guy should a been sent
out on a tough job like this one,” was all that Perk
remarked, half under his breath, as though what
Jack had told satisfied his curiosity, and further
increased his respect for the brave brother officer
whom he knew only by report.</p>

<p class='c011'>These things were bound to crop up in his mind
from time to time, and give him reason for further
thought; for whatever the sad fate of Simeon
might be it seemed to have some connection with
their own fortunes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Perk’s roving fancy came back again to
the adventure through which they had so recently
passed, with such wonderful success. Figuratively
he patted himself on the back, because it had been
wholly his conceit, that of setting their grim four-footed
jailor on fire, and causing the beast to break
the siege in hot haste.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! not so bad—fur me,” Perk told himself,
with one of his queer chuckles. “Ole Perk he kin
wake things up once in a coon’s age, if he sets his
mind on doin’ the same. Kinder guess it’d pay me
to sorter cultivate that streak o’ ingenuity—mebbe
I’m movin’ along to be some sorter inventor like
Tom Edison—yeou never kin tell ’til the time
comes. ’Twouldn’t be so funny after all, come to
think o’ it—my ole man had a gift thataway, even
if he never did set the State o’ Maine on fire. Huh!
if things keep on amovin’ like this, little ole Perk
mebbe’ll amount to some punkins after all!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch19' class='c015'>CHAPTER XIX <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Taking Great Chances</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Jack could read his chum almost as easily as he
might an open page. Consequently he readily surmised
what was making the other feel so good—he
saw Perk’s chest swell up, and his whole person
partake of the joy that accompanied his secret
thoughts. Not for worlds though would he wish
to let the other know how it amused him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let him enjoy the thrill while it lasts, the dear
old chap,” he told himself in a whisper. “It isn’t
often he plays the high hat role; and after all’s
said and done his queer little game <i>did</i> pan out just
fine—no shooting, or whooping things up; just
making it hot for that ill-tempered live wire of
a silvertop bear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>What was causing Perk to feel so good was the
thought of what would happen should any one
ever again try to coax that identical bear to partake
of the tempting fluid that had brought about
his recent panic and flight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Me, I’d shore hate to be in his shoes, if that
big hulk broke loose an’ made things fly,” was the
way he wound up his soliloquy; when other more
vital matters began to engage his attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was by now long after noon, and as usual
Perk had begun to feel a bit “queer” down in the
pit of his stomach. For this feeling there was, as he
very well understood, but one sovereign remedy.
Accordingly he gave a little tug at his companion’s
arm, and hastened to suggest:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jack, haow ’bout holdin’ up, an’ having aour lit
snack—aint no tellin’ when a better chanct’ll come
aour way, I kinder guess?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It wouldn’t be a bad idea, Perk; and to tell the
truth I’m feeling as if I needed a bite or two so’s to
keep up this climbing. Hold on, here’s as good a
spot as any—let’s go!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Two minutes afterwards and they were seated
crosslegged on the ground, amidst a generous
growth of covert, which would likely screen them
effectually from any prying eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack realized that by this time they must have
climbed far enough up the mountainside to bring
them fairly close to the opening of the pass that
led into the valley of the giants.</p>

<p class='c011'>If this were true then it behooved them to exercise
a greater amount of caution than ever, lest
they betray themselves to some vidette who might
be posted near by.</p>

<p class='c011'>With this idea in view he considered it the part
of wisdom to take Perk into his confidence, so that
as they exchanged views they could tone down their
voices to the whispering stage.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile Perk had produced the aforesaid
“snack” in the shape of a small package, neatly
done up by that efficient waiter friend, and containing,
it turned out, another kind of sandwich,
with a tasty brand of cheese as the “filler.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jest didn’t dare try to hitch that ere tank o’
hot coffee along on this tough hike, partner,”
explained Perk apologetically, after listening to
the need of caution mentioned by Jack. “So we’ll
have to munch this spread dry; or else locate a
spring so’s to wet aour whistles.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That isn’t much of a hardship,” he was told;
“but we may be lucky enough to run across fresh
water; and you could fill that empty flask of yours
if you wanted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By gum! not a bad idee that, Pal Jack; shore
I’ll do that same right willin’ly, if the chanct comes
aour way. Haow ’bout the next move, sense it
seems we’ve got this far okay?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve been trying to figure that out,” Jack told
him, reflectively it could be seen. “I’ve studied the
conformation of the ground, which is something
out of the general run; Simeon’s rude chart helped
me a lot in the bargain. This enclosed valley, you
understand, has high cliffs around it, with possibly
only one way to go in and come out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeah! I get yeou, buddy—meanin’ the queer
pass that’s so narrow three hossmen couldn’t enter
abreast—is that straight, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Absolutely so,” came the immediate reply, accompanied
with a smile, as if it pleased Jack to
understand how readily his comrade entered into
the explanation he had offered. “That being the
case it seems likely we might be able to keep on
climbing until finally we reached a place where we
could find a screen close to the top of such a cliff.
That would give us a wonderful eyrie like an eagle
would select to build her nest on; and from which
place we could look down into the entire valley.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hot-diggetty-dig! but woudn’t that be a
scream, oh! boy?” gasped the deeply interested
Perk, in whole-hearted enthusiasm, as he nodded
his head in approval. “Let’s do jest that, then,
partner. Why, with the glasses as I fetched along
for keeps, we could spy aout everything we’d want
to know, an’ mebbe find a way to git into the valley,
withaout usin’ that guarded pass.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just so, Perk, and I notice you’ve got a strangle
hold on the situation, which pleases me a heap.
You see, there were a few hints in what our good
friend Simeon incorporated in his brief notes, that
started such an idea in my brain; so once again
we’re indebted to his scouting for putting us wise
to a good thing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bully ole Simeon—he’s all wool an’ a yard
wide I’m a tellin’ yeou Jack, as the boys used to say
in aour village when I was a smart-aleck kid.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then that’s settled,” Jack announced, with
finality, “and we’ll keep on climbing after we get
some rest, and finish our lunch. I’ve an idea I
can catch the sweet song of a brook up above, so
we’ll be able to wash down this dry stuff in fine
style.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good for that, partner,” gurgled Perk, with
his mouth almost full, so that he was in danger
of choking; and Jack, noting the fact, refrained
from making any further remarks calculated to
tempt the other to splutter out a reply, or a comment
of some sort.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once while thus engaged in “feeding,” as Perk
always called the act of satisfying hunger, he
chanced to lift his eyes above the high margin of
the gully, and immediately stopped munching what
he had in his mouth. Those sailing buzzards were
still making their wide loops as they always do
when scanning the face of the country for miles
in search of their next meal; and somehow the
very sight of them took away part of the satisfaction
Perk was feeling in filling up a vacuum
“down-below-stairs.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drat the foul birds!” he muttered, half to himself;
“they shore do make me tired with their
everlasting wheelin’ an’ cavortin’, atryin’ to see what
sorter grub we got daown here thet they’d like
to gobble. Gosh all hemlock! haow I’d like to knock
their red blocks off with a scatter-gun!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack understood enough not to make any remark
calculated to cause his pal to again worry
his mind over what could not be remedied—the
mysterious vanishing of poor Simeon Balderson.
And presently Perk chirked up, as though he could
put the grewsome matter out of his mind so long
as he refrained from watching the constant evolutions
of the carrion birds.</p>

<p class='c011'>As they devoured their last sandwich, feeling as
though they had had quite sufficient, somehow
both were silent. Jack contemplated remaining
there in that sheltered nook for a further brief
rest, after which they would again take up the
tedious and arduous climb.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mebbe we had orter be on the move, partner,”
Perk finally suggested in a low whisper, just as
though he feared lest a host of hostile ears might
be hidden from sight by the nearby thickets. “I
’low I’m right daown thirsty, an’ a swig o’ that
gurglin’ stream’d come in fine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just as you say, Perk,” with which remark
Jack started to arise; and presently both were
toiling upward, stepping carefully, and endeavoring
not to brush against the branches of the stubby
pinons as they advanced slowly on the way toward
their goal.</p>

<p class='c011'>A minute or so afterwards found them lying
flat on the ground, swallowing generous quantities
of the cold, icy water that was running down the
rugged slope in a zigzag fashion, due to the innumerable
obstacles that caused it to make little
detours, since water must always seek its own
level, and will find different means for so doing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly Jack lifted his head, swallowing hastily,
and made a low hissing sound that thrilled his
companion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Voices near by—somebody coming this way,
perhaps for a drink—we must get a move on or
we’ll be discovered! After me, Perk, and be still
as the grave,” was what Jack whispered in the ear
of his mate as he commenced crawling away.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch20' class='c015'>CHAPTER XX <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>On the Encircling Cliff</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Considering the fact that neither of the two
Service men could boast of having graduated from
the school of born scouts, and that their education
along the line of the crafty pioneers was a bit off-color,
it was simply wonderful how successfully
they managed to creep into the thickest of the
surrounding heavy growth without making any
noticeable noise to betray the fact of their passage.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Jack fancied they had covered sufficient
ground he gave Perk a signal with his foot—an
old trick with the well paired couple that they had
worked to advantage on numerous occasions.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thereupon, when Jack halted his snake-like
progress, the other glided alongside; and thus they
lay so close together that if necessary they could
exchange a few words in whispers, although most
likely Jack would forego this privilege.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sound of conversation had grown much
louder, accompanied by the swishing of bushes, as
two or more persons continued to follow some sort
of narrow path undoubtedly leading to this wonderful
little rivulet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now the speakers must have reached their goal,
for the voices were stilled, as though the men might
be lying flat, and quenching their thirst in something
purer than the poor stuff with which they
were probably wont to seek the much desired kick.</p>

<p class='c011'>Both of the hidden intruders strained their ears
in hopes of making out what was being said, and
thus possibly acquiring a little useful information;
but the men spoke in such muffled tones this expectation
failed to materialize—the deep, rumbling
tones of one, and higher and shrill voice of the
other, accompanied by occasional laughs, kept on
for at least ten minutes; then from the sounds
growing fainter Jack and Perk understood the two
men must be going back the way they had come;
from which fact they judged the opening into the
closed valley must lie in that quarter, almost due
north-by-east from their present refuge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dog gone it! an’ I ain’t wise to a single thing
they was a sayin’,” Perk lamented, half under his
breath, after they could no longer catch the faintest
sign of the pair who had been so near them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Same here,” added Jack, “which was too bad,
for we might have picked up a little useful information
while they talked and laughed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gee! I strained my hearin’ so hard it near
cracked my ear-drums, I bet,” continued Perk,
with a shake of his head; “but it was all rumble an’
squeak, mixed in a mess. I shore never did hear
so high-pitched a voice on a man in all my born
days.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I have; and if you’ll think back some
you’ll remember just <i>one</i> occasion in the bargain—both
of us remarked it as a queer kind of a
voice—particularly for a big, bold fellow, who
scorned to show a sign of weakness even when
hemmed in, and taken prisoner by a couple of
fresh Secret Service detectives, belonging to the
Flying Corps.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The effect of these words on Perk was electrical—he
started as though he had been shot, stared
hard at his companion, then grinned broadly, and
gave vent to his feelings in a suppressed <i>roar</i>—as
near as he dared under such sensitive conditions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, well, well—hot-diggetty-dig! what a
blind loon I am, not to ’ve s’pected that same! Yeou
mean that boob was no other than Slippery Slim
hisself, the Ole Scratch we’re runnin’ after right
at this minute, doant yeou, partner mine? Glory
be! what a great chanct we lost o’ fillin’ aout aour
job in the start—why, we could aturned back to
the ship, gone aboard, an’ cut loose at two miles a
minute fur the home airport, with <i>him</i> safely
bagged.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the other hand, Perk, we might have given
ourselves away, and let him slip out of our hands;
when it would be ten times as hard to capture him
as if he didn’t dream we were around this district.
Depend on it this is all for the best—we’ll imitate
the hungry wolf, and lie in ambush until such time
as we can pounce down on Slim, and carry him off
unbeknown to the balance of the gang.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeah! I kinder guess that’s ’baout the ticket,
partner; but it gives me a bad case o’ the willies
jest to think haow close we was, an’ let ’em skip
aout. Gee! I’m in a cold sweat, drat the luck!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“While I was listening to his coarse language,
and hard rasping laugh,” Jack went on to say,
softly; “do you know what came into my mind—a
picture of that cottage in the suburb of San
Diego, where we took that clever little lad we
managed to keep from falling into the jaws of the
mad dog.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve thought o’ the same many times since we
left town,” Perk declared, in a sincere tone that
bespoke his feelings in the matter. “Nice ole lady,
too; an’ it gets me jest haow a boy could treat sech
a fine mother like he’s done—he orter be tarred an’
feathered, that’s my ’pinion!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t jump at conclusions that way, brother,”
Jack interposed, as usual seeing further than the
more impulsive Perk. “First of all, we’re not so
dead certain he <i>is</i> her son, and that sweet child his
boy—we just guessed as much because that was
surely Slim’s moniker on the wall we glimpsed.
But then the chances are, no matter what his
relations may be with the old lady, she’s never
really known what a bad egg Slim’s been. I’ve
heard of cases where a wife of ten years standing
still had faith in her man, and believed him to be
simply unfortunate. So we mustn’t feel so positive
until we know more; although it looks as if Mrs.
Ferguson must think him a good guy, the story
of his crimes having been kept from her ears,
either through accident, or a desire to save her
mental suffering.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mebbe that’s it, Jack—yeou kin see deeper into
sech puzzles than I ever could. But I only hope
we manage to pick up leadin’ clues, an’ find aout
’baout that matter ’fore we’re through with this
case.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Believe me, we’re going to do all of that, Perk.
Once we get our man again, and are aboard our
good ship, headed for port, we’ll see that he opens
up and explains a good many things that so far are
wrapped in mystery.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I kinder guess that’s right, buddy,” was Perk’s
comment; after which they ceased whispering, to
turn their full attention upon the task ahead—that
of climbing still higher up the face of the steep
mountain, with the idea of securing a full view of
the hidden valley, and all contained therein.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whenever a good opportunity opened up for an
observation Jack studied the nature of the ground
above them.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this fashion he felt capable of deciding when
they had gone as far as was needful in order to
carry out their purpose, and secure an unobscured
view of the wonder valley, with all it contained.</p>

<p class='c011'>Both of them experienced more or less curiosity
along these lines, as was most natural. So much had
been said concerning the hard gang of bad eggs
who had taken up their quarters in this wild locality—they
had caused such a riot of annoyance to
the authorities at Washington, on account of their
periodical forays, and the apparent impossibility
of breaking up the defiant group, that anything
connected with their life in the mountain fortress
must appeal strongly to each and every Secret
Service man.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then besides, the unknown fate that had overtaken
the last two gallant adventurers who had
dared to try and beard the tough lawbreakers in
their den—and which had only latterly come to the
ears of Jack and Perk—was calculated to invest
the whole subject with a tinge of mingled romance
and sheer adventure, such as added to the thrill.</p>

<p class='c011'>It began to look as though they might reach
their objective with an hour or so of daylight
remaining, in which to take an observation. Later
on, as they sat, or lay resting after the strenuous
climb, they could compare notes, and begin to build
up something of a plan of campaign.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I reckon,” said Jack, softly enough, after one of
those halts, during which he always made up his
calculations, “we’re as high as we need go. By
sheering off here to the right we’re apt to strike the
top of that high cliff we spotted. Then we’ll have
all the chance we want to get rested.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shucks! I aint a mite tired, buddy,” Perk assured
him, between breaths; “on’y short o’ wind, as
yeou might say. Some climb, b’lieve <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Get your breath then, Perk; and if you’re ready
say when.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go to it, ole hoss!”</p>

<p class='c011'>They exercised due caution, and gradually
swung around in a half curve, when Perk gripped
the arm of his mate, to hoarsely exclaim:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thar she be, partner, openin’ up like a book
right ahead o’ us!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch21' class='c015'>CHAPTER XXI <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>All on a Diet</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Steady then, boy—we mustn’t give them a
chance to glimpse anything moving up here, or the
fat’ll be in the fire. A step at a time, and mighty
slow at that!” Jack warned the hasty Perk.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sun lay low toward the western horizon, as
seen through a gap in the mighty snow-capped
mountains lying in that quarter. It happened that
there was a line of scrub growing close to the edge
of the cliff; and which the quick-witted Jack saw
would prove a very effective screen for them to
hide back of.</p>

<p class='c011'>Down on hands and knees they dropped, to begin
crawling inch by inch toward their objective. A
cat creeping up on a sparrow, or a fat robin, could
not have displayed a greater amount of sagacity
and caution that those two man-hunters exhibited
then and there—every little move was a gem; and
Perk, keeping close to the heels of his leader, was
fain to thrill with admiration over the wonderful
skill shown by Jack in making this advance.</p>

<p class='c011'>By slow degrees they opened up an amazing
vista as they drew closer to the brink of the cliff—it
was a spectacle such as neither of them had ever
laid eyes on during their entire past life—that
glorious green valley lying like an oasis amidst
grim mountain ranges, making the contrast clean-cut,
and magnificent indeed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Later on no doubt Jack would drink the scene
in with avidity, since he was a great lover of the
picturesque; but at that particular moment there
happened to be other things demanding their sole
attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>The valley itself was the only frame that surrounded
the picture most interesting to their
minds. Those who had gathered under the effective
leadership of the man whom they had been credited
with sending to the Federal penitentiary not so
many moons back, were the objects of their
dangerous journey into these untracked wilds;
and they were most eager to learn just how they
were living in their hidden retreat—also what their
mode of slipping out to make a bold stroke, and
then disappear again most mysteriously, might
be.</p>

<p class='c011'>First the further end of the valley came under
their view, but with never a moving figure, nor
yet any sign of huts or tents to indicate the presence
of human beings.</p>

<p class='c011'>By slow degrees they widened their line of
observation—objects closer at hand began to be
noticeable, and finally they discovered the first
shack. It was only a place used as a shelter for
animals, which would indicate that they had a
herd of ponies in the valley, where doubtless there
would be found plenty of grass for grazing, even
throughout the severe winter season.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack’s first impression ran along the line of what
a wonderful prize such a rare mountain retreat
must some day prove for cattle, driven from the
open range by the coming of cold, and heavy snows.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ah! a second structure now bobbed up; but like
the other it had the look of a rough shelter unsuited
for human use. Others by degrees came along, and
Jack counted nearly a dozen up to the time he
struck quite a commodious log cabin, looking like
some he had seen in times gone by when in a logging
camp in Michigan, where a bunch of loggers
cutting timber during the winter, had to be kept
warm when feeding.</p>

<p class='c011'>Men were clustered around this structure, some
lying on the ground, while others sauntered about,
evidently talking and joking; although any sounds
they might be making came but faintly to the
strained hearing of the watchers up on the heights,
so great was the distance separating them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hot-diggetty-dig! thar they be, partner, the
hull kittin’ crew,” Perk ventured to say, softly; for
as yet they did not know whether a lookout or
vidette was kept posted, where he could have a
range of vision covering many miles out over the
rock strewn country toward the east and south.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just a round dozen in sight,” muttered Jack,
who was already using the binoculars; “but at that
there might be as many more in the huts and
shacks. Away off there to the north, where the
grass looks greenest I can see a small herd of
ponies feeding; remember, Perk, some of those
accounts hinted that in all probability they conducted
their raids on horseback, and faded away
again completely after striking.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! seems like they got a reg’lar <i>system</i>
organized,” grunted the observant Perk, staring
off to the section where Jack indicated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s all the work of our old friend, Slippery
Slim,” he was told in terms that would not admit
of any denial; “he’s shown in his past jobs he’s a
wonderful organizer—if he had been straight, and
in the army, his genius might have pushed him far
up the ladder; as it is he’s only been able to prove
one of the nastiest thorns in the flesh the Government
ever tackled.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I kinder guess it’ll be a relief if we carry
this job through to a finish, and get the critter
landed for keeps back where his wings’ll be fair
clipped.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You said it, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack still held on to the glasses, finding it so
interesting trying to locate this thing and that; but
then Perk had most astonishingly keen eyesight,
and could pick up considerable information unaided.
He was accustomed to staring into dim far-off
spaces when aloft, which added to his ability
in that line.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lower dropped the sun.</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently the shadows would come trooping out
of their hiding-places, where they holed during
daytimes. Jack realized that, shut in as the valley
was by those beetling cliffs, the twilight must be
already falling down yonder—yes, he could notice
the failing light, and inside of a brief time darkness
must wrap everything in its dark folds, save
where possibly some fire continued to burn, and
dispel the gloom.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I figure that they do most if not all of their
cooking inside of that long log cabin, and eat there
to boot,” he explained to his companion, eagerly
listening.</p>

<p class='c011'>“More organization stuff, eh?” grunted Perk;
“then like as not they even got some kinder cook,
or <i>chef</i>, to handle the pots an’ pans. Flyin’ high,
I’d call it, partner—alivin’ off the fat o’ the land
mebbe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why not, when they’ve pulled off some mighty
big shake-downs during the last few months, and
must have raked in a heap of dough? With the
coin you can buy all sorts of good things to eat;
and don’t forget how they’ve got a special delivery
ship, that is able to tote half a ton or more of
freight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whew! jest to think o’ that,” breathed Perk,
making a face as if some extremely painful thought
had flashed through his excited brain; “an’ heow
we on’y got <i>four</i> slim sandwiches to fill up on—hardly
a bite apiece.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tough luck, that’s right, boy,” said Jack, cheerily;
“but such old campaigners as we are shouldn’t
squeal because we miss a few meals. Easy enough
to make up for lost grub when we’re all cleaned
up, and sitting pretty. Besides, just as like as not
I’m going to ask you to trot back to our ship in the
morning, if you’re agreeable.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! surely not to stay, while yeou’re up here
by yeour lonely—don’t tell me that, Jack, ole pard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hardly, buddy; I’ll need your help too much to
divide our forces in front of the enemy, or when
crossing a stream, which is a bad time, they say,
to change horses. I meant that you could make up
a big bundle of grub, and tote it along; for there’s
no telling how much time we’re going to squander,
loafing up on this roost, and watching how things
go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gosh! <i>that’s different</i>, partner; of course I’d be
glad to slide daown there, take a peek at our boat,
load up with some stuff, an’ make it back here ’bout
middle o’ the afternoon—if I’m lucky.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, you’ve just <i>got</i> to be lucky, and not spill
the beans, that’s a foregone conclusion, Perk.
Every foot of the way you must keep on the alert,
and take no chances of discovery. But it’s getting
so dark down in the valley we might as well shut
up shop for the present.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Meanin’ it’s the end o’ a perfect day, eh, what?”
asked Perk, as he started to “back water,” and
push away from the screen of scrub bushes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, we’ve accomplished a few things worth
remembering, so the time hasn’t been exactly
wasted, Perk. But the main job still lies ahead
of us, remember, brother. It’s going to be no small
job either, to separate that slick rascal from the
balance of the gang, and carry him off in our airship,
without having to fight a regular battle with
the mob.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk scratched an ear, and then remarked
softly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It never could be done if left to a lad built
like me, I’m tellin’ yeou, my boy—couldn’t make
the grade, which is a fack. Some galoots air built
that way, yeou savvy? But, so long as I got a
pal to lean on I aint worrin’ ’baout not bringin’
home the bacon, not me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“None of that baloney, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They continued to back away until Jack decided
they were far enough distant from that dreadful
brink of the mighty cliff, to avoid any possibility
of falling over if by chance they “walked in their
sleep,” as Perk had been known to occasionally do,
when something was weighing heavily on his mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let’s have those last few sandwiches that you
held out at lunchtime,” Jack remarked, settling
down to make himself as comfortable as the conditions
allowed. “Good thing too, you were so
thoughtful, since only for that we’d have gone to
sleep with empty stomachs, which is rather hard
on a fellow as fond of chow as some one I know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m guilty, all right, Jack—eatin’s one o’ my
shortcomin’s for a fack—allers did count the
hours ’til the horn’d blow fur dinner-time—age
haint changed little Gabe Perkiser a whit, an’ never
will, I kinder spect. Take yeour pick—jest two
each, an’ haow I wish I’d a told him to make ’em
double thick—why, dang it they on’y be a couple
o’ bites each, sech bites as I take.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Half a loaf’s a lot better than no bread—be
philosophical, buddy, and as you munch your fodder
keep thinking what you’re going to do punishing
the grub when the time of plenty rolls along,
which it surely will do in good time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They sat there exchanging remarks in cautious
tones, and making the slender allotment of food
go just as far as possible—as might a child nibbling
all around the sugar coating on the top of his
cake, “keeping the best for the last.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Goin’ to be some cold, in the bargain, seems
like,” suggested Perk, whose mind always ran to
picking out the thorny parts, and forgetting the
pleasant ones lying in wait for them later on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! well, we ought to know what cold stuff
means, after being miles high so many hours at a
time, and in an open cockpit at that, remember,
Perk. What can’t be cured must be endured—there’s
going to be a lot of good times when we’ve
wound up this game for keeps, skip back to old
San Diego, and that jolly little restaurant we
know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeah! providin’ we aint knocked aout o’ the
runnin’ ’fore that time, ole hoss,” grumbled Perk.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch22' class='c015'>CHAPTER XXII <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>The Man with the Cook’s Cap</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Somehow Perk’s mind seemed to dwell most persistently
on their lack of a comfortable fire. Many
a time he must have been in much sore need of
warmth than on the present occasion, and could
“grin and bear it.” He wondered himself at his
frequent grumbling, and at one time even openly
confessed to Jack, as though his guilty conscience
had begun to reprove him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Doant jest know what ails me, partner, to kick
up sech a big row over standin’ things—must be
I’m agettin’ right old, an’ near my second childhood.
I’d sure give somethin’ to be able to warm
my hands at a cracklin’ fire right naow; an’ seems
like I wouldn’t get much o’ a snooze, when I’m a
shiverin’ to beat the band, with nawthin’ warm
inside me neither.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’ll crawl a little further along to where we
can get out of this chilly breeze. It’s because we’re
so high up we feel it so. I’m meaning to take a
look around tomorrow, and see if I can’t run across
some sort of a hole, or crevice, where we’d be a lot
more comfortable nights.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! might as well make it a reg’lar <i>cavern</i>
while yeou’re ’baout it, partner; not as I’m
atall greedy, see; but I always <i>did</i> want to explore
a gen-u-ine cave, ever sence I read Mark
Twain’s ’Tom Sawyer’ an’ ’Huckleberry Finn’
books.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just as you say, brother, it’ll have to be some
kind of a cave then, so you’ll feel satisfied—anything
to keep peace in the family. But for just one
night we must put up with whatever comes along,
and take it out in thinking how fine we’ll be another
night, with a warm hole in the rocks, perhaps
a nice blaze going, and all those good things
to eat you mean to lug up here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say, have heart, wont yeou, partner, an’ please
don’t aggravate the situation so bad? If yeou hear
me a rollin’ off a list o’ dishes like the waiter does
in a cheap chop house, don’t knock me any, ’cause
like as not I’ll on’y be a talkin’ in my sleep.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When they had devoured the last crumb of their
limited supply of ham sandwiches the change in
the campground was effected; and just as Jack had
prophesied, the cold wind did not seem to strike
them as keenly as before.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stand it as long as you can, Perk,” Jack told his
mate, before they thought of turning in, “when you
get to shivering too much, the only thing to do is
to get up, and start your daily dozen in exercising
your arms violently; but make no noise on your
life. We don’t know when one of those brutes may
be prowling close by, and upset all our tricks by
knocking over the apple cart.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Needn’t fear I’m sech a silly as that, ole hoss,”
Perk assured him, indignantly. “But what I wanter
ask is why couldn’t some fellers that knowed haow
to slip daown a rope withaout burnin’ their hands
to a crisp, drop into that same valley as neat as
wax, while night hung on?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Simple as falling off a log, that’s okay, Perk,
old pal; if <i>only</i> you happened to have a rope, and
it was long enough to do the business.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shucks! allers is some kinder drawback to
every game I hatch up—we aint got any rope fur
a fack; which is too bad, aint it? Guess as haow
if we ever do get inside that ere valley we’ll shore
have to sneak in by way o’ the narrer little pass. If
so be they got a sentry on deck there, why, we’ll
have to poke him in the neck, an’ put the gink to
sleep.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Too early to be settling that matter, before
we’ve located things,” Jack argued. “Always a
chance of something popping up that we don’t
know about, and which’d solve our troubles. First
let’s try and get a few winks of sleep, because I for
one feel as though I needed it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was fated to be about as mean a night as they
ever could remember, and undoubtedly they had
both experienced many poor ones. Jack managed
to drop asleep, to awaken later on to find himself
shivering, and with his teeth rattling like castanets
in the dextrous slim fingers of a Spanish dancer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Something was moving near by, and, looking
that way he could just manage to make out, with
the starry heavens as a background, a figure with
numberless arms, so it seemed, shooting up and
down with mathematical precision.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack chuckled, realizing how it must of necessity
be his pal, Perk, who, also awakened by having
shivers run over his entire system, had remembered
the advice given him, and was doing
his daily dozen several times over, to induce a circulation
of warm blood in his extremities.</p>

<p class='c011'>Like a good doctor, not averse to taking his own
medicine, Jack hastened to scramble to his feet;
after which there were a pair of them industriously
working their arms like flails on the threshing
floor, taking steps in unison backward and forward.
Perk fell in with the trick, and managed to
keep time with his companion, as though it might
all be a huge joke.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, after they began to feel more comfortable,
they again lay down to try and get a little more
sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wonder what time it kin be, Jack; caint get
a peep at my wrist watch in all this darkness,
yeou know?” Perk was asking, turning as always
to his reliable comrade when in any trouble.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Somewhere around three, I’d say, according
to the lay of the stars overhead,” came the ready
reply, proving that Jack had for his own comfort
challenged the chart of the skies, which was well
known to his understanding, from long practice
in reading the ways of the planets.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Kinder guess that’s ’bout so, an’ I’m glad
on’y a few more hours got to be endured, when
mornin’ll come along, and mebbe the warm sun’ll
show his nose to help aout some.”</p>

<p class='c011'>After that Perk must have gone to sleep, for
Jack did not hear him speak again. If Perk felt
compelled to get up and do some more exercising
later on at least he did not arouse his companion;
for when Jack once more opened his eyes it was
to see a faint light over toward the east, to prove
that dawn was well on the way.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was feeling greatly chilled, and losing no
time hastened to get up and commence that swinging
of his arms; also punching an invisible bag
again as though he might be a pugilist at his regular
exercises, in view of an approaching fistic
battle in the arena, amidst cheering multitudes of
frenzied fight fans.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, too, Perk speedily realized what was
going on, and joined forces with the early riser, making
all sorts of remarks, both in lament and otherwise,
and keeping time with his vicious lunges.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take that, yeou pizen critter, an’ a few more o’
the same stripe, to make yeou take the count for
keeps! Haow dye like that swipe, I’m askin’ o’
yeou,—a sweet upper-cut I got a copyright on?
That’s a bit under the belt, mebbe, but ev’rything
counts in this mill—there aint no foul blows. An’
by the same token I’m beginnin’ to feel some better
a’ready, Jack, ole hummer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Before ten minutes had passed both of them
were content to call a halt, as their arms were beginning
to feel the strain, and they found themselves
no longer chilled to the bone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hot-diggetty-dig! it’d be simply scrumptious if
on’y we had a good breakfast on top o’ that exercise,”
with which gruesome remark Perk pulled
in his slack belt another notch, under the impression
that by increasing the pressure on his empty
stomach he could cause the distress to disperse.</p>

<p class='c011'>The light in the east had been growing brighter
all this while, having taken on a pinkish tinge
that announced the speedy coming of the king
of day. Of course it would still be dark down in
the valley, so there was no use as yet in their moving
over to their shelter of the preceding afternoon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Seems like I might get a move on, an’ be
agoin’,” Perk suggested; nor did the other try to
place any obstacle in his way.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing to hinder you, buddy,” Jack was telling
him, holding out his hand with a smile. “I’m
not going to say another thing about being careful,
because I’m dead certain you’ll be on your guard
every minute of the time. Only, if set upon fight
with all your might; for you must know men like
these jail birds, most of them I reckon having
broken out of bondage, hate our class as the devil is
said to detest holy water; and they’ll never give
you a decent chance if you surrender.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Perk, that veteran of the war across the
big pond, nodded his head as he went on to say
nonchalantly, as became a soldier of fortune:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeou want to understand, partner, if I jest
have to turn my toes up to the daisies in this game
I’m agoin’ to have some company along the road
to shadow-land, yeou bet yeour boots on that same.
Ta! Ta! an’ look fur me araound sunset, er earlier
if I kin make it a go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack hated to see him depart, but it was all in
the line of business; and many unpleasant things
have to be endured in following the path of duty;
none realizing this truth better than men in the
Secret Service, where they never know at what
minute they may be called upon to risk life and
limb in carrying the summons of the Law into all
manner of dens and hideouts, where potential
criminals may be lying in ambush, with machine-guns,
and bombs, ready to bring destruction to the
daring officers of Justice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack, as soon as the early morning mists had
cleared away, began work. He had laid out a dozen
important things he wished to see through, and as
a beginning once more posted himself in a recumbent
position behind the friendly screen of those
stunted bushes, close to the edge of the steep descent—a
most colossal precipice it now became in
his eyes, although always in the nature of a cliff to
dwellers of the sunken valley some hundreds of
feet below.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course, as he dared not creep any closer to the
brink, he was unable to make any sort of survey of
the near section; but he fancied the more important
huts and shanties were within range of his
glasses.</p>

<p class='c011'>He moved his hands with the utmost care, for
how was he to know when the bright rays of the
rising sun might glint from the magnifying end
of the binoculars, attracting the attention of some
suspicious man far beneath by the brilliant flash
that was bound to follow a hasty movement?</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides, Jack felt constrained to keep himself
in touch with a retreating line of brush, in order
to make a quick getaway should any alarming
sound, like the fall of a dislodged rock, give warning
of the possible approach of some curious investigator.</p>

<p class='c011'>By degrees he familiarized himself with every
part of the depressed ground falling under the
scope of his glasses. In so doing he paid a great
deal of attention to the long, low log cabin, which
he had in the beginning decided must be a dining
hall, and general loafing quarters.</p>

<p class='c011'>Men came and went, and several of those who
reappeared, after a protracted stay within, seemed
to be wiping their mouths, as though they had
been eating. Then it was finally decided without
the least doubt, when a man wearing an apron that
may have once been white, and a similar peakless
cap, evidently serving as a general cook, came out
and emptied some left-overs into a wooden pail,
so it could be carried away, to be devoured by buzzards,
or possibly skulking foxes and coyotes, perhaps
even timber wolves.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch23' class='c015'>CHAPTER XXIII <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Perk Carries on</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Apparently Jack found considerable interest in
the man wearing the white cap of a cook, for he
watched him keenly as he came and went, limping
a little, it seemed, as though somewhat lame.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, as the morning drew on, Jack changed
his location, as though desirous of applying his
energies to another duty that claimed attention.
He was away from his post all of three hours; and
when once more creeping over to the friendly
screen of scrub bushes, there was a satisfied look
on his grim face, that gave him an air of renewed
confidence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Apparently things were working along the right
path, which would mean he found them to his liking.</p>

<p class='c011'>If Jack felt exceedingly hungry, with so little
to stay the clamorings of an empty stomach, he
gave no evidence of such a thing. But then he did
not happen to belong to the class of “squealers,” as
honest Perk often delighted to assign himself,
without a blush of shame—he was built to expect
three square meals per diem, and felt he had a right
to “kick” when, through some misfortune they
failed to come along on schedule.</p>

<p class='c011'>The afternoon wore away slowly, with Jack in
continual use of his glasses. It was a most interesting
study for him, this spying upon the hideout
of the greatest aggregation of badly wanted refugees
from the Law he had ever run across.</p>

<p class='c011'>What a grand haul would result if only he
chanced to have a dozen of his fellow workers in
the Secret Service at his call, ready to draw a net
around the sunken valley, and forcing a general
surrender. A good many empty cells in the Federal
penitentiaries would be filled with their former
occupants, Jack was telling himself, as he strove
to count the idle members of the gang sunning
themselves, and taking things so comfortably, as
though they refused to entertain a single minute of
fear concerning the possibility of the army being
used by Uncle Sam to encompass their downfall.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack now began to anticipate the return of his
comrade, judging from the manner in which he
frequently turned his head, as if to listen, while
a look of concern began to draw lines about his
eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fact that he had seen no sign of excitement
among those he was watching had given him good
cause for confidence. Surely, if the presence of
strangers in the neighborhood had been discovered,
with possibly Perk made a prisoner, he must
have noted the fact as he viewed the panorama
spread out before his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was when the descending sun had dropped
well down the western sky—about five by his faithful
little wrist watch—that all of a sudden he
heard something drop just back of his position,
followed by a low, shaky voice saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hot-diggetty-dig! say, I’m ’baout all in, for a
fack—gee whiz! sech a climb, with a pack on my
back that weights somethin’ like a ton. Whee!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And there was Perk, flat upon his back, having
been drawn down when he attempted to let his
burden drop. Jack gained his side as speedily as
he could, his mind at ease once more, his late fears
having vanished like a puff of mountain fog before
a rising breeze.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mighty glad to see you safe back, buddy—was
just beginning to feel a bit anxious—but you
shouldn’t have attempted to lug such a whopping
bunch of stuff up this steep grade.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk gave him a wise grin, and managing to
find his voice he went on to say, in a jerky manner
between breaths:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Didn’t reckon to in first place, Jack—after
I hitched to aplenty yeou know I ’membered ’bout
somethin’ else—then saw a package o’ grub I jest
did want to try eout the wust kind—so she climbed
to this mounting—but it’s okay—we kin make
use o’ ever’thing, bet yeour boots we kin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope you did what I told you to—eat a good
lunch while you had the opportunity?” Jack asked,
solicitously, whereat the other slily winked one
eye, and made reply:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure thing, partner—easier to swaller the grub
an’ carry same <i>inside</i>, than to tote it on my back.
But queer haow a gink keeps on buildin’ up a
appetite, fur somehaow I’m hungry as all git-eout
agin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That was just like Perk; but Jack had to chuckle
at the lugubrious expression he could see on his
comrade’s expressive face as he announced this sad
fact.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” he told the returned scout, “we’ll eat as
soon as we get further away from the cliff; I’ve
got some things to tell you that may sound interesting;
but not a single word until I’ve had a
chance to break <i>my</i> fast.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Great guns! Jack, ole hoss, I forgot as haow
yeou aint had nary a bite all day long, while I
was jest <i>gorgin’</i> myself daown yonder!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“First tell me, was the ship okay?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure was, Jack,” the other went on to state, as
he managed to regain a stooping position, with the
mighty pack still on his back, assisted by a friendly
push at the hands of his ally.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack seemed to breathe easier, showing that he
had really worried about the possibility of something
happening to their air courier, such as must
put a halt to their operations, if not entirely smashing
the same.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Fore I started back,” continued Perk, who was
now wound up, and capable of running on for any
length of time, his wind being assured, “I took time
to toss some more o’ them evergreens on exposed
parts o’ the crate. She’s camouflaged neow to beat
the band—kinder guess a galoot with the eyes o’
a hawk might pass by less’n fifty feet away, an’
never suspicion what that big mound was. But
there ain’t been anybody araound there since we
cut aout—I’m givin’ yeou that straight, Pard
Jack.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Shortly afterwards they settled down in a secluded
spot, where the brush grew thick enough
to effectually conceal their presence, assisted in
this friendly task as it was by various piles of
rough rocks, such as were as plentiful in that wild
country as “grains of sand on the seashore,” Perk
had more than once declared.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack held to his resolve, and refused to say another
word until he had taken the sharp edge off
his appetite. Just then he doubtless could appreciate
how his always hungry chum must suffer between
meals.</p>

<p class='c011'>By the time he had been munching the stuff
the sympathizing Perk kept putting before him,
for something like ten minutes, the acute sensation
had passed away.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk had also been doing a little side act of his
own, and managed to put away a fair proportion
of eatables. He was waiting as patiently as he
could for Jack to start telling what he meant by the
word “discoveries;” and hoping something entertaining
might be forthcoming.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m glad you saw fit to fetch that big flashlight,
<i>ditto</i> the two extra dry batteries along, buddy,”
observed Jack, finally; “because we’re going to
find a good use for the same. I’ve entered a claim
for a nice dry residence, which we can use while
we’re in this region—rain or shine, cold or otherwise,
it’s a sure enough jim-dandy <i>cave</i>!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bully boy, Jack; I’m tickled pink to hear such
good news; when do we move in, tell me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Right away—that is, by the time darkness
comes along, Perk; because it isn’t a great way off—a
fissure in the big rock that looked sort of inviting
to me; so I crept inside, with a splinter of
dry wood that I could coax to burn. Couldn’t see
all I’d have liked to, but enough to tell me the
crack developed into a regular cavern, with a roof
fully twenty feet up, and feeling a heap warmer
than we found ourselves last night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whoopee! that sounds right fine to me, cully;
I’m sure glad yeou hit sech a prize package fust
shot. But I jest knowed yeou’d be adoin’ yeour
stuff when I was a crawlin’ ’long daown there in
the bottom land. I’m crazy to take a squint at
aour new lodgin’; but I guess there aint no sech
hurry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Plenty of time for everything,” Jack assured
him, still engaged in the pleasant task of feeding
the furnace fires within. “We can have a great
chin once we get settled; and Perk, I spent a full
hour toting a lot of wood into that split in the
wall.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Meanin’ as haow we kin even have a bully little
fire—all the comforts o’ home, an’ nary a red cent
to pay for rent, in the bargain. Ain’t we the lucky
boys, though.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Listen! that’s a familiar sound I’m picking
up, eh, what, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure is!” cried the other, showing signs of
sudden excitement. “Some sorter airship headin’
thisaways. Must be that ole crate belongin’ to
the boys daown in the valley; let’s git back to the
cliff, an’ see what’s what, Jack.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch24' class='c015'>CHAPTER XXIV <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>In the Tom Sawyer Cavern</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“She’s acomin’ closer right along, Jack!” Perk
was saying, cautiously, as he limped along at his
companion’s heels, evidently more or less tired
after his long tramp, with that great pack settled
on his back.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack realized this fact himself. He was keeping
a wary eye turned in the quarter whence the roaring
sound could be heard, constantly growing
louder with each passing second. If he suddenly
discovered the approaching plane he could give the
plodding Perk the “high sign”, when both must
drop down flat to keep from being discovered by
those in the ship’s cabin.</p>

<p class='c011'>As it happened the incoming aircraft was keeping
low down, its pilot undoubtedly expecting to
swing into the valley by way of the spreading
jaws of the narrow pass.</p>

<p class='c011'>By the time they managed to gain their old location
the landing had been successfully accomplished,
a fact that caused Perk to remark:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! them guys arunnin’ that crate aint no
dummies at their job, sure as shootin’. That was
a slick landin’ the gink at the stick set daown.
Wow! See haow they’re aswarmin’ eout o’ evry
shack, will yeou; like this comin’ back o’ the
patched-up ship might mean it was afetchin’ ’em
all sorts o’ stuff they kinder hankered after? What
a soft time them rats air ahavin’, with nawthin’ to
do ’cept wait fur the supper bell to sound.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Watch and see what manner of stuff they take
out of the cabin,” advised the wide-awake Jack,
with an evident hope he might learn a few “wrinkles”
concerning the occupation of the confederates
in this mountain retreat, by thus checking
their plane’s cargo, for he had noted that it was
heavily laden.</p>

<p class='c011'>There seemed to be an abundance of willing
workers now, and the way the freight was lifted
out of the cabin, to be carried toward the big log
cabin, told of the personal interest they had in
the stuff.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Looks mostly like grub, I’d say,” Jack remarked,
keeping his eyes fastened to the useful
binoculars; “and I reckon business, whatever it is
they’re carrying on, must be good, for them to buy
such a mountain of food, staples and fancy groceries
in the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk could be heard making a queer sound in
his throat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m a piker if this doant beat anythin’ I ever
stacked up against,” he gritted between his teeth.
“Hard times, they say, an’ yet here’s a bunch o’
tough guys aloaded up with ’bout sech truck like
a oil-well nabob daown in Oklahoma might lay
in fur the hull winter. Mebbe I wouldn’t like to
board up at this hotel fur a spell! I’d sure make a
dent in their ole grub pile.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The plane cabin was soon emptied, and apparently
it had held an enormous cargo. They saw
the two men forming the crew head toward the
dining hall, as though to await the call to supper.
Perk, having begged to hold the glasses, was
eagerly staring at the pair, wearing dingy flying
togs.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hot-diggetty-dig!” he muttered, just loud
enough for Jack to hear him, “so <i>that’s</i> what took
ole Nat outen San Diego, was it? Did somethin’
to make him want to skip by the light o’ the moon,
an’ then hitched up with this ere rotten bunch
o’ crooks. He sure had it comin’ to him, bein’ he’d
been skatin’ on the edge o’ goin’ bad some time
back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You seem to know some one, Perk, from what
you’re saying?” ventured Jack.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeah! a galoot called Nat Tucker, once a fair
sorter pilot; but kinder crooked, some folks used
to say behind his back. That’s him, the stouter lad
with a limp—got that onct when he had to step
off a mile high, an’ his chute didn’t work as nice
as it orter, lettin’ him crash when he landed in
a hay field—would a been killed if it’d been rocks,
like these here. Found his level okay when he
struck this rotten crowd. Had a sorter nice halfbreed
squaw fur a wife, too, pretty as a picture;
but I heard she kicked Nat aouten the house, so
he’s cleared up fur keeps. Well, he’s kinder classy
as a pilot, an’ said to be a reg’lar dare-devil in his
way. The boys’ll sure be some s’prised to hear
what’s happened to ole Nat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the crowd down in the valley had thinned out
by this time, most of them passing into the big log
cabin, Jack concluded there was no necessity for
himself and Perk to remain any longer at their
lookout point.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once back at their former campground Jack
picked up his supper at the point he had quit when
the sound of the oncoming airship drifted to their
ears.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk looked expectant, as though he still remembered
that his chum had promised to enlighten
him concerning various discoveries made during
the day just then closing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve been figuring things out,” Jack commenced
saying, as he continued his interrupted meal, “and
from a number of little things I saw I’m almost
certain these banded crooks must be carrying on
a bogus-money plant up here—several times when
the wind changed I thought I could catch a queer
sort of sound that was along the line of machinery,
a press perhaps working at printing the counterfeit
bills.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gee whiz! I wonder!” ejaculated the deeply
interested Perk, his eyes aglow with half suppressed
excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stop and figure it out for yourself, buddy,”
Jack went on smoothly, as though his own mind
was already fully made up. “Could anybody think
up a finer and safer location for such an illegal
plant than up here, where they could carry on their
work without molestation? And then, when they
had a good grist of bogus stuff to scatter over the
western country, how easy to send it out aboard
that swift airship? I warrant you they’re doing a
land-office business—no stagnation in this neck of
the woods, even if it’s said to be the case nearly
everywhere else all over the world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gosh! doant it beat the Dutch, Jack, haow
chumps like that kin lick up all the cream on a pan
o’ milk, leavin’ the skim stuff to honest folks?
But yeou said yeou’d picked up a heap o’ pints,
which I’d hear ’bout later on. Aint that time come
’raound yet, buddy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hold your horses, Perk; that news can keep
until after we get located in our new sleeping quarters.
Suppose we divide up all this stuff you’ve
fetched, along with what we already had on hand;
so I can help tote the same. I can see with one eye
how you must be fairly worn out with what you
carried all the way up here. Come, let’s get a move
on, partner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk did not show much signs of being so dead
tired, judging from the alacrity with which he
scrambled to his knees, and busied himself making
up the two packs. One, which he evidently
fully intended for himself, was about twice as
heavy as the other; seeing which, (and comprehending
the usual generous spirit of this big-hearted
chum) Jack managed to pick it up when
the other was not looking, and absolutely refused
to surrender when appealed to.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not any, partner,” he told Perk, resolutely;
“what do you take me for, a weakling, or a shirker?
If you say much more I’ll sling <i>both</i> packs over
my shoulder, and leave you to trot along in the
rear. I’ve done nothing but loaf all day, while you
were as busy as a beaver. Get out, and stay out,
d’ye hear, boy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He led the way, and seemed to know just where
he was going, passing around a dozen great rocks
that barred their passage. Perk marveled at his
pal’s skill and memory as a guide, never pausing to
question his route, but following the circuitous
trail as though he had trodden the same for a long
time.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finally, when they had descended the slope for
a short distance, Jack stopped in front of a minor
cliff, and pointed to the fissure in question.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll go on ahead with my flashlight, and you
keep close to my heels, Perk,” he explained. “So
far as I could tell there’s nothing apt to trip us
up; but its just as well to be on your guard, with
a clumsy bundle on your back, and your legs being
a bit tottery after that long climb. Ready, buddy—then
in we dip.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk could not keep from feeling something of a
thrill as he followed his partner into the fissure,
which seemed to widen the further they advanced.
Presently he could no longer glimpse either wall,
and hence came to the conclusion they must have
already reached the large cavern mentioned by
Jack earlier in the evening.</p>

<p class='c011'>Coming to a halt the leader shifted his hand
torch in such a fashion that both of them were now
able to see the walls, as well as the high ceiling
of the natural cavern. Perk could not repress an
exclamation of mingled satisfaction and awe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hot-diggetty-dig! but aint this jest grand?”
he burst forth. “Me always a feelin’ a yearnin’ inside
to glimpse what yeou’d call a reg’lar cavern,
like Tom Sawyer an’ Huck Finn explored, daown
on the bank o’ the Mississip; an’ here she be like
magic. Say, this takes the cake, partner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Welcome to our new home, brother,” laughed
Jack, but not hilariously; “and now to drop our
packs so as to rest up.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch25' class='c015'>CHAPTER XXV <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Squatters’ Rights</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Yeou doan’t reckon as haow anybody kin see
a fire, if so be I started a little blaze back in here,
do yeou, partner?” queried Perk.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack knew how the other was fairly itching just
to feel the warmth of a genuine campfire, under
such extraordinary conditions, and hence shook
his head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not a Chinaman’s chance, buddy—too many
crooks in the passage we took getting here. The
wood I fetched in lies just back of you; and besides,
a fire will save my battery, which means a
heap. Go to it then, and get busy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Accordingly Perk lost no time in carrying out
his cherished plan, for he had always vowed himself
to be a “reg’lar cat o’ a fire-worshipper;”
so, the match having been applied they were
treated to a generous glow that revealed much
more plainly the character of the wonderful cavern.</p>

<p class='c011'>Later on the investigating Perk discovered that
another fissure, shaped somewhat like a regular
tunnel, led away from the central cavern, and
sloped downward.</p>

<p class='c011'>His mind seemed to still follow up that Mark
Twain idea, for he had no sooner taken a good
survey at the passage entrance than he gave Jack
a shrewd look, and followed this up by saying
ingenuously:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! if I didn’t know we was a heap o’ miles
away from the ole Mississip I’d be ’clined to swear
this must be the gen-u-ine cave Tom and Huck
knocked ’raound in the time they found all that lost
treasure. But I wonder—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you wonder, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Struck me that mebbe aour ole friend, that
silvertip bear, might have his den somewhere ’bout
in the rocks; an’ where’d he run ’cross a better
place to hole up fur the winter than right here!
Say, mebbe I wouldn’t hate to run smack on the
ugly critter while we was a explorin’ some o’ the
tunnels an’ passages that lead outen this here central
chamber? They kinder give these here grizzlies
a reputation fur havin’ long memories, jest
like elephants do; an’ I bet yeou a cookey he aint
never agoin’ to furget little Gabe Perkiser, what
throwed a match into his hair, an’ set him afire.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Jack did not appear to have such a lively
imagination as his comrade, for he shook his head
in the negative, and tried to soothe the anxious
Perk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hardly think there’s any chance for such a
nasty happening, buddy,” he assured the other;
“though I do reckon the old chap’d never forget
you, after receiving such scurvy treatment at
your hands. Some time later we’ll take a look in
at that same passage—these caves in the mountains
often turn out to run for a mile or more, twisting
and turning, to come out it may be close to
the starting point, even in the shape of another
fissure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say, I’d like that same trick, I’m atellin’ yeou,
Jack, boy. ’Sides, bein’ partial to caves o’ all kinds
an’ species I’m also given to explorin’ queer places—got
me into heaps o’ trouble in my kid days,
which same makes me laugh to remember. But
tell me some more things yeou thunk up, or seen,
while I was aout wrastlin’ fur grub.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack looked at him in a peculiar way that caused
Perk to wonder what he was about to spring upon
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Remember my telling you about that cook
chap they’ve got, waiting on them, and all that,
Perk?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure do, him with the s’posed to be white <i>chef’s</i>
cap—was he any different from the general run—cook,
crook, seems to me they sorter hitch like they
might be first cousins.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There was something that seemed familiar
about him, but it was only later in the day I
managed to glimpse a better look at the fellow, when
the sun shone full on his moniker; then it flashed
on me who he was.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hold on there, partner, I jest hopes yeou ain’t
agoin’ to inform me he’s yet another galoot I useter
know—seems like that Nat Tucker, added to
aour ole friend, Slippery Slim, might be enough
former ’quaintances to meet up with in sech a nest
o’ flim-flam artists an’ crooks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I think you told me once you’d never
known this party; but I had, and only a short time
back I told you more or less about him. It was in
Washington I used to run along with him in my
work.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wait up, partner—go slow ’til I ketches my
breath. Yeou ain’t agoin’ to stagger me by sayin’
that this here cook might be <i>him</i>?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just what I mean, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Simeon—Simeon Balderson?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No other, brother, undoubtedly a prisoner, and
being made to serve that miserable gang of hoodlums
in a menial capacity, partly to humble him,
and give them plenty of chances to throw mean
jibes at him as the representative of the Service
they hate so much. It’s the irony of Fate, if ever
such a thing could be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dead certain be yeou, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The other nodded in the affirmative, adding:</p>

<p class='c011'>“He must have been badly injured in the scrap
before he and his companion were knocked out, for
he certainly never limped like that when I knew
him, only a year or so back. Possibly the second
man may have been wiped out in the gun battle;
though why they should spare Simeon’s life is a
puzzle to me; but some day we’ll understand, since
I wouldn’t think of going away from here and
leaving him in the hands of those human tigers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shake on that same, ole hoss; I’m with yeou
every time, ’cause it means we’re agoin’ to have
some mighty stiff work on aour hands ’fore we kin
send a ball daown in each alley, an’ make a clean
sweep o’ the duck-pins; an’ that’s the dizzy game
I sure likes most.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was really nothing like brag about what
Perk said, as his comrade knew full well; in the
past he had seen Perk put up a grand fight, and
never could forget how he slashed, and cut, and
struck home with any old weapon he chanced to
have in his hands, until a clean swathe had been
cut through the ranks of their foes. He always
appeared to be a little ashamed of having lost his
head, and striking blind, excusing himself under
the plea that he must have been in a bit of a “tailspin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here we can stay, Perk, without running much
risk of being discovered; for I hardly imagine any
of those chaps would bother exercising themselves
to try and find out what the country around their
Happy Valley looks like.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! I kinder guess not any,” remarked the
skeptical Perk, with a look akin to disgust on his
face; “they’re a heap too lazy to move, ’cept to
come to their three meals a day when off duty, and
kept in camp. Same men when on a raid robbin’
some border bank; holdin’ up a train; or nice
healthy jobs like that, kin act like a pack o’ half
starved locoed wolves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was just thinking,” continued Jack, who
seemed never to lose a point worth considering,
“that perhaps we’d better make sure our eats are
kept secure. Such places as this cavern would be
attractive dens for foxes, and such predatory varmints,
who’d like nothing better than to steal every
scrap of food we’ve got; which would be a serious
thing, I’d allow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wall, I kinder guess it sure <i>would</i>, by hokey!”
exclaimed Perk, quickly aroused, as the danger
loomed along the line of possible starvation, “an’
it ain’t agoin’ to happen either, if I have to stick
’raound all night long. Grub an’ me air the best o’
friends; an’ I’d go a long way to defend sech a
good pal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hardly be so serious as that, buddy,” advised
Jack, seeing how his suggestion had awakened
lively fears in his companion’s breast. “Plenty of
loose stuff lying around in here, so we’ll just <i>cache</i>
our food supplies, by covering the pile with a
heavy weight no beast could budge.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeou said it, partner, an’ I’ll take a look
’raound till I kin pick aout the best place to build
aour fort. Watch my smoke, Jack, boy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It did not take him long to find what he sought,
after which they speedily arranged things to suit
their idea of security.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There she be,” Perk remarked, in a satisfied
tone, as the job was finished. “If any red fox or
kiote kin scratch his way under that stack o’ dornicks
I’ll eat my hat—an’ ole dungarees in th’ bargain.
I ain’t a luggin’ good eats all the way from
San Diego, an’ payin’ aout lots o’ coin fur the
same, jest to make a holiday fur four-footed
thieves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Both of us are dead for sleep, I reckon,” ventured
Jack, as they lay on the rocky floor, Perk
indulging in the luxury of a pipe of his favorite
Turkish mixture for solace; “and perhaps we’d
be wise to snatch a few hours while we may—we’re
up against a pretty hard proposition, and there’s
no telling just what lies ahead of us. How about
it, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shucks! I’m willin’ enuff to lay off; an’ mebbe
naow I ain’t glad I done fetched them two woolen
blankets along as we had on aour cots aboard the
ship. They sure helped to make up a fine load; but
right naow they’ll be wuth all they cost me on the
hike.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I’ll bless your long-sightedness in thinking
of our comfort,” Jack hastened to assure him.
“Bare rocks like these are hardly in the same class
with a good spring bed, and plenty of covers. We’ll
skip some sore bones because of having these to
tuck under us, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hate to let the bully fire die down,” Perk
presently observed, for he never was so happy as
when sitting alongside a cheery blaze, puffing at
his briarwood pipe, and watching the rings of
smoke sail upward.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! it wouldn’t do to try and keep it going all
night,” Jack told him. “Too little stuff for burning,
and hard to tote in here. I’ll keep my electric
hand-torch close beside me, and if there’s any occasion
for lighting up the cavern I can do it in a
jiffy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That seemed to ease Perk’s mind somewhat,
for Jack could plainly see the other was somewhat
concerned regarding the possibility of their having
an unwelcome visitor during the time they were
resting from the fatigues of the past day.</p>

<p class='c011'>He watched Perk making his preparations for
retiring, and just as he anticipated the other was
exceedingly careful to pick out a camping place
as far removed from that mysterious passage leading
out of the central cavern as he possibly could.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course the reason for his so doing was plainly
manifest to Jack—he could spell it in four letters—B-E-A-R—Perk
could not wholly dissuade himself
that Fate meant to play him a nasty trick, and
bring him into close quarters with that ferocious
monster, the silvertip, or as he was known along
the mountains of the Coast, “Old Eph.” The distinct
smell of burning hair still seemed to linger
within reach of his olfactories, and give him a reproachful
sensation, as though he felt he had taken
a mean advantage of the beast.</p>

<p class='c011'>No such thought worried Jack; but then the
shadow of guilt did not hang over his head as was
the case with Perk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t forget to wind up your wrist-watch,
buddy,” warned Jack, shortly afterwards; as Perk
still sat there on his blanket, keeping up his meditative
puffing, as though he meant to see the fire
to its last flickering extinction. “They’re our only
reliable guide to tell us when morning comes
around. In this black cave we might lie dozing until
the middle of the day, without knowing how
we were sleeping at the switch, and wasting precious
time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hot-diggetty-dig! partner, haow yeou do jest
think o’ ever’thing. On’y fur yeou I’d be like a lost
lamb awanderin’ ’raound the countryside, bleatin’,
an’ shiverin’ fur fear the pesky wolves’d get me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’ll do for you, buddy,” Jack sternly told
him. “We’ve both got our several good and bad
points; but we’re essential to each other to make
up a working team, six of one, and half a dozen
of the other—now, don’t let me hear you getting
off any of that boloney stuff again, mind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! yeou lets me daown too easy, partner;
guess I know my shortcomings better’n anybody
else; an’ thinkin’ ain’t much o’ a long suite with
Gabe, not at no time in hist’ry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, have it any way you like, Perk; but I’m
meaning to settle down for a nice nap. Just call
out if you want a light any old time, and I’ll accommodate
you before you can say Jack Robinson.
So-long, and here’s hoping we’ll be able to get a
move on before another night sets in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I sure echoes that wish, boy,” muttered Perk,
seriously; for he realized that they had undertaken
one of the most troublesome tasks that could be
placed to their credit; and would have need of all
the good luck and breaks possible in order to come
through.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk having set himself to what he considered a
duty, would never let any trivial things deter him;
and so he must have sat up with that declining fire
until the very last feeble flicker expired; then rolling
himself up in his blanket he sought relief in
slumber.</p>

<p class='c011'>Time went on, the night passed away, and there
was not a solitary alarm to give Perk a thrill.
Both of them were very tired, and must have slept
soundly, for the first thing Perk knew Jack turned
the dazzling light of his little torch full on his face,
arousing him, and then remarked quietly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Time we were stirring, partner—I figure the
dawn has got around, when we can start doing
things.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch26' class='c015'>CHAPTER XXVI <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>A Back Door to the Valley</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A hasty breakfast was eaten, washed down with
a few swigs of cold liquid refreshment, which the
ever obliging Perk had fetched up in a bottle taken
from the ship for the purpose, and filled with coffee
from their gallon Thermos jug.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus the adventurous pair felt well braced for
whatever duties the new day had in store for
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’ll divide our force for the morning,” suggested
Jack, knowing only too well his chum would
take his words in the way of a command, for he
occupied the position of leader, and Perk was only
too willing to accede to each and every suggestion
his mate advanced.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jest so, partner,” Perk instantly commented;
“an’ what air yeou agoin’ to pass on to me, I
wanter know?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack picked up the glasses, and handed them to
the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’re a vidette on the lookout this morning,
buddy,” he explained. “Up in our old place you’ll
keep watch on the valley, to note everything that
takes place, so you can pass it along to me. Keep
your eye particularly on those two figures whenever
they’re in sight—Slippery Slim Garrabrant
and the cook, whom I believe to be Simeon Balderson,
a prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Consider it done, ole hoss,” Perk went on to
say, firmly. “Yeou’ll sure git a report o’ all the
doin’s when we meet agin. Anyways I got a purty
good mem’ry, if I am short o’ some things.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When noon comes by the sun, make your way
back to the entrance of our cave, where I’ll be
waiting with my flashlight to fetch you in here.
In the afternoon, possibly both of us will go on
guard up above.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I notices, Jack, as haow yeou allers say <i>down
here</i> when yeou mentions this cave; haow do yeou
make that aout, partner?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s simple enough, Perk, if you stop to remember
how we kept descending more or less all the
way from where we entered by means of that split
in the rocks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk wagged his head as if to acknowledge that
was something absolutely true, even though he
himself had not previously noted the fact.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Partner, if so be it’s jest the same to yeou,
may I ask what line yeou goin’ to foller while I’m
on sentry duty—I likes to be posted, that’s all?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Which is perfectly all right, Perk; and I’ll just
say I expect to look around here a bit, and find out
a few things that have struck me as possible, even
if hardly probable. I’ll give you the gist of what
success I have in my prowling around when we
are taking a snack at noon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I git yeou, Jack, an’ it’s all to the good with me
every time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack chuckled, for he had noticed the quick and
significant glance his comrade shot across the cavern
toward that yawning opening marking the tunnel-like
passage Perk had held in such suspicion
just before they wrapped up in their blankets and
sought forgetfulness of their troubles.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just the same Jack did not undertake to explain
what he had in mind; it was his usual habit to make
his investigations first, and follow up with explanations
afterwards, when he had figured things
out, and proven his point sound.</p>

<p class='c011'>He convoyed Perk close to the opening where
the fissure split the rocky wall—here after a laconic
“so-long” they separated, and Jack retraced
his way back along the winding passage.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk again climbed the hill until he was able to
creep back of those friendly scrub bushes. Here
he could lie flat on his stomach, and cautiously
survey pretty much all of the wonderful valley
spread out before him like a genuine panorama.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus he spent all of the morning, occasionally
changing his position when finding that his limbs
were becoming more or less cramped. During this
time Perk was busily storing his mind with dozens
of incidental happenings down in the camp of the
fugitive criminals, banded together for preying on
the forces of law and order, which they held in contempt
in carrying out their occasional forays, with
defenceless banks, or unprotected trains carrying
United States registered-mail sacks, as the objects
of their special regard.</p>

<p class='c011'>He thus saw the outlaws’ patched-up airplane
make an ascent, and head off toward the southeast,
rising to pass over the lofty peaks lying in that
general direction many miles distant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Kinder guess as haow Jack he’ll be some int’rested
in what I kin tell him ’bout the little cargo
they stored in the crazy ole cabin o’ thet crate, all
right,” Perk was muttering to himself, while he
watched the ship growing less and less distinct,
as it soared through a fleecy cloud, and began to
look very much like some distant buzzard, or vulture.
“’Less I’m way off in my figgerin’ them three
packages might a been the last printin’ o’ bogus
bank notes they was asendin’ aout to ther agents in
some cities daown Texas way. Didn’t I read in the
papers on’y a short time ago, that there never was
knowed to be sech a raft o’ bad money in the
country ’long the Rio Grande; an’ sech good
imitations o’ Uncle Sam’s genu-ine currency it
faized the bank tellers to pick it aout. ’Baout time
I’d say we got busy, an’ stopped up the hole in
the dam, ’fore the hull kentry was flooded with
the stuff.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He knew when it was getting close to noon by
the clamor arising down where he lived, and after
that kept a close watch on the glowing sun. Finally,
when the time seemed fully ripe, Perk started to
creep away, arriving promptly at the fissure, to
have Jack show himself, and beckon him to come
on in.</p>

<p class='c011'>Back in the central cavern they built a little
fire, in order to save the precious battery of Jack’s
hand-torch; and seated close together proceeded
to again lower the stock of eatables.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By close economy we ought to have enough
grub to carry us through a couple of days after
this one,” Jack observed, while they were munching
what was intended to be a mere lunch; Perk
announcing his intention of doing a little cooking
at their later evening meal, he having fetched
along a pound of sliced bacon, a few raw potatoes,
and some onions, to which latter he admitted being
very partial.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sorry we ain’t got any coffee up here,” he said,
a bit sadly; “but it stands to reason yeou jest
caint ’spect everythin’ when yeou’re on the trail
o’ bad gunmen like we air right naow. I ain’t
kickin’, remember, Jack, ole man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently, when they had about finished their
frugal lunch Jack asked his companion to make his
report. This Perk did, giving many different suggestive
happenings that he had noted in rotation,
and emphasizing his words at certain points.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ve done a good job, Perk,” the other assured
him, when the end of the story was reached.
“In lots of ways what you’re reporting strengthens
our previous convictions—there can be no
possible doubt about the cook being our fellow
worker, Simeon; and so it goes without saying
that when we kick out of here its got to be with
two others in our company—Slippery Slim, and
Simeon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s okay with me, partner,” agreed Perk,
eagerly; “an’ we’ll keep on deck in this here nest
o’ snakes ’til we kin put the game through—no
matter if we gotter go withaout a bite o’ chow
fur a hull week—kinder guess I kin stand it as
long as yeou kin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing else you noticed, partner?” queried
Jack.</p>

<p class='c011'>“On’y that the ole crate she skipped off ’bout a
hour after I settled daown back o’ them nice
bushes,” came the ready reply; after which Perk
went on to describe how the man they knew as
Slippery Slim seemed to be so careful of the several
packages, and the leather bag he handed over
to the pilot of the plane; and which Perk was so
dead certain must contain the latest printing of
notes off the press they could sometimes hear
rumbling down at one of the cabins, in and out
of which some of the men were so frequently passing.</p>

<p class='c011'>This additional information seemed to please
the listening Jack exceedingly, to judge from the
way he nodded his head, and smiled knowingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Things are breaking for us, I’d say, buddy,”
he told his mate, to the other’s satisfaction; “and
by slow degrees we’ll carry on, step by step, until
one of these nights we can explode our bomb, and
play the game to a finish. But it happens that you
haven’t got a monopoly of the good news.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hully gee! then yeou been a nosin’ ’raound this
queer hole back o’ the cliff, an’ mebbe run acrost
somethin’ wuth knowin’, eh, what, partner?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just what I have, Perk—I started in to explore
the black, tunnel-like passage that you kept
your eye on last evening.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say, doant tell me yeou run acrost that big
hill-billy o’ a grizzly, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’re a bad guesser, matey,” he was assured;
and then Jack added: “Found that the passage
kept dropping down all the time; and in the end I
came to another fissure, with broad daylight ahead—then
looked out into the valley; and found I was
only some twenty feet from the bottom of the big
ditch, Perk!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch27' class='c015'>CHAPTER XXVII <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Pike’s Peak, or——Bust!</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>When Jack made this dramatic announcement
Perk manifested such supreme astonishment,
coupled with delight, that his eyes looked as if they
would jump out of his head. He reached over and
clutched the other’s hand, which he proceeded to
squeeze unmercifully, as he burst out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hot-diggetty-dig! but <i>did</i> yeou ever hear o’
sech great luck in all yeour born days? Why, it
seems like there might be a back door to the Hole-in-the-Wall,
after all; which mebbe nary a single
boob in the bunch has ever discovered!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I figured it all out while down there, and peeking,”
Jack continued to explain; “and felt certain
what you are saying was absolutely true. You see
the fissure lies high up on the wall, and there seems
to be a narrow slanting shelf running down nearly
to the bottom, where green grass is growing that
would hide a trail of footsteps wonderfully, if
we decided to drop into the valley while night
lasted, and investigate; possibly get in touch with
friend Simeon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Great stuff yeou’re a givin’ me partner; looks
like ever’thing might be arunnin’ for a fall with
them tough guys. They’re so dead sure nawthin’
kin reach aout an’ git ’em, they trust to dumb
luck, an’ lays ’raound puttin’ on layers o’ fat,
playin’ keerds an’ agamblin’ away sech cash as they
got in the divide-up arter the last scoop.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let’s hope Fortune will keep on smiling, Perk;
but just the same we’ll keep our wits sharpened,
and let no opportunity for making a point pass us
by.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! guess naow as haow yeou mean we gotter
to trust in the Lord, but keep aour powder dry;
like the ole Pilgrim Fathers uster do in Colonial
days,—as I’ve read in hist’ry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Exactly,” concurred Jack, to add, as though he
could not quite get over the great satisfaction his
latest discovery gave him: “but look at the advantage
we now have, being able, as I think is certain,
to go and come in and out of the valley, without
any one being the wiser.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jest so, Jack, we doant need to try an’ slip
past the sentry we reckoned was on duty at the
narrer pass—kinder got my goat wonderin’ haow
in tarnation we was agoin’ to chuck <i>him</i> overboard
when the time kim along. Naow we needn’t bother
headin’ thataway, ’less we wanted to keep them
boobs plugged up inside the big hole. Doant furgit
I fetched along some bombs that cud do the
trick, an’ mebbe blow up that ere pass sky-high,
makin’ a reg’lar jumble o’ things which they
couldn’t climb over, it might be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not a bad idea at all, brother,” Jack told him,
with an admiring look. “When it comes to doing
<i>big</i> things, especially with all kinds of bombs,
(even to mustard and the tear sort) you take the
cake. Wait until we get our final plan going, and
we’ll see what can be done to give them a great
scare. With their leader missing, and the entrance
to their valley fort laid in ruins, I reckon they’d
cut and run for it, thinking Uncle Sam would
now send a force by air ship to round them up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gosh amighty! but things <i>do</i> look good to me,
partner,” Perk could not help saying again, with
his face wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’m first meaning to take you down
through that passage, and let you have a glimpse
out through the second fissure in the cliff. I’d like
to make certain, if we dared take the risk, that the
sloping little trail is safe enough to let us creep
down, and come up again, in case we decided to try
and get in touch with Simeon this very night!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wow! that same ’peals to me like all get-aout,
partner. Le’s shake a foot right away an’ <i>go</i>,”
was Perk’s energetic appeal, as he got to his feet,
primed for fresh adventure and discoveries—always
ready to “do things.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Accordingly Jack led the way into the hole in
the wall, his little hand-electric torch lighting up
the passage, so there was no risk of either of
them stumbling when they “took a chance,” as
Perk would say.</p>

<p class='c011'>Later on, after they had arrived at the terminus
of the down-grade, Jack whispered directions
in his chum’s ear, and started him off to take
his first view of the valley floor from that lower
level. Perk was extra careful not to expose even
his nose, in securing this thrilling survey, and
came back fairly bubbling over with excitement,
also enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c011'>They sat there within sight of the daylight
streak, talking in whispers, and exchanging comments
on the situation. Afterwards they both
crept forward, and commenced a careful survey,
even to poking out a head when it seemed judicious
and safe to do so.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps,” suggested wise Jack, after a while,
“we’d better get busy at the old stand, where it’s
easy to watch everything that goes on in the enclosed
valley. I want to fix the points so carefully
in my mind, that I could move around in the blackest
night, and keep clear of the different huts and
shacks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You would—that’s right,” commented Perk,
firm believer that he was in his best pal’s ability to
carry on where most other men must give up, and
seek help; “any feller what could fly blind through
the worst sea o’ fog that ever was seen, kin do
like he had cat’s eyes, an’ could see things in the
pitch dark.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You rate me much too high, brother; if I’m
any judge you’ve got far better vision for distances
than I ever boasted. But it’s always been one of
my pet schemes to build up my memory by what
you might call a brain photograph that I can depend
on to give me my points when in a fog, or
the blackness of midnight. But come on, let’s be
moving upwards again, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Before another half hour had expired they were
once more crouching back of their friendly brush
screen, and taking turns in making good use of
the powerful binoculars.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lucky thing, Jack, we didn’t leave these here
bully glasses behind by mistake when we fixed to
start on this same little jaunt an’ adventure,” Perk
was saying, almost under his breath, as he handed
the object in question to his companion, making
each movement slowly, so as to keep from attracting
attention to the top of the high cliff.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That could never happen to us, brother,” Jack
told him, with conviction in his tones; “because
wherever we go in our task of getting some particular
man the Government wants badly, these
same glasses are worth their weight in solid gold—don’t
make any mistake about that, partner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! I’d say six times over, they air, Mister.
’Member haow we used ’em daown there in
Florida, when chasin’ after them wind-jammer
planes the smugglers were usin’ to fetch in all
kinds o’ stuff that didn’t pay any duty—hard
booze, diamonds, even yaller Chinks what was
willin’ to set up the long green flimsies so’s to get
a footin’ on U. S. A. soil. They helped us kerry
aout aour plans jest fine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The long afternoon slowly passed, and as evening
drew on apace Jack was ready to call it a full
day.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m loaded for bear, as they say, Perk,” he
announced, showing signs of giving up the lookout,
with the gathering of shadows far down below
in the long valley. “I mean by that I fancy I’ve
got all my bearings down pat, and couldn’t better
the same no matter how much time I spent.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gosh all hemlock! partner, does that same
mean we kin get started this very night to make
contact with Simeon?” demanded the duly thrilled
Perk, backing out on hands and knees from his
covert.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why waste any more time when there’s no
need?” Jack told him. “A bad spell of weather
might come along to knock our plans silly; or
perhaps these chaps down yonder might have some
scheme that would take them pretty much all away
on a big lay. We couldn’t play our hands if the man
we want so badly has gone off with his crowd,
to hold up some bank, or treasure train, could we?
So while the stars hold out to shine up in the sky,
and things seem to be fairly quiet with that mob,
we’ll see what luck we have. I’ve got it figured
out that Simeon must sleep in that dun-colored
army tent close to the cookhouse, and dining hall;
so that’s bound to be our main objective tonight,
after we land in the valley.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! only thing I got to worryin’ ’bout, partner,
is <i>dawgs</i>,” said Perk, with a particular emphasis
on the last word.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I know they seem to have several bow-wows
in the settlement; but as a rule they’re common
riffraff stuff—never a sign of a police dog, or
collie; so we needn’t anticipate any trouble from
such measly mutts, only good to play with, or gnaw
a bone. So let’s figure we’re going to make connections
with Simeon tonight, if it’s any way
possible, or know the reason why.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeah!” Perk added joyously, “Pike’s peak—or
bust, it is—make it unanimous ev’rybody.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch28' class='c015'>CHAPTER XXVIII <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Invading the Tigers’ Lair</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Having thus decided to begin work that same
night, naturally Jack and his best pal were more
or less concerned as to what the weather promised.</p>

<p class='c011'>As aviators they had become accustomed to
securing the very latest Government report as to
the probabilities ahead, so that by now this had
become a habit. The knowledge that there was a
strong likelihood of a dense fog along their proposed
route—perhaps signs of a war of the elements,
not only put them doubly on their guard,
but often proved of value in meeting and overcoming
the threatening danger.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this instance they had no weather sharp to
give them a clue, founded on late wires from different
points, as to the velocity of the wind, its
direction, the chances of snow or rain, perhaps
electrical disturbances in the bargain—now everything
must depend on their own ability to figure
things out through taking note of the heavens, and
kindred storm indicators.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack was a fair weather prophet himself, though
never so bold as to claim absolute perfection; yes,
and Perk too prided himself on knowing considerable,
also able to tell when any severe upset was
in the offing—though it must be confessed he was
rather inclined to depend on an aching corn, or
some sort of queer itching in his joints, to be able to
prophesy a sudden change in prevailing conditions.</p>

<p class='c011'>So they studied the sky, noted the passage of
certain types of clouds, as well as several other
heralds of the weather in prospect; and finally
agreed that, unless something came along to materially
affect matters, they could reasonable expect
quite a lengthy spell of seasonable weather.</p>

<p class='c011'>At any rate the fact that both reached the same
conclusion was looked upon as promising double insurance—several
days would surely see them
through their big job, and that was all they asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>Accordingly, having settled that part of the arrangement,
they started for their underground
retreat, feeling that thus far everything seemed to
be working in their interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk was looking wonderfully pleased, and Jack
could give a good guess just why this should be
so. It had been arranged that on this fateful evening,
when their mission was on the eve of taking
a fresh spurt, Perk was to be permitted to actually
<i>cook a meal</i>—such as the camp larder allowed.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had asked his comrade concerning the possibility
of the odors betraying their hiding place;
and Jack told him there was not one chance in a
hundred of such a thing coming about.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Already you’ve been smoking in our cave, and
the odor of your tobacco must have floated out
to the open air; but from what we’ve learned no
one ever comes up this way—those lazy panhandlers
down there wouldn’t bother themselves to
scout around. So its perfectly safe to fry your
bacon, and even make coffee—if you’ve got any
sort of a vessel to contain the same.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jest leave all that to little Perk, Senor Jack,”
the other told him, in half suppressed excitement;
“I’m the lad as kin sling the hash to beat the band.
My innards air yellin’ fur a gen-u-ine hot meal,
’cause cold stuff doant seem to touch the spot. Git
ready to give yeour tummy a treat fur a change.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They were back in the cavern when this little
discussion took place; and no sooner had a decision
been reached than Perk commenced his preparations;
Jack meantime busying himself with pencil
and paper, figuring out certain little problems connected
with their programme for the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>Later on Jack began to lift his head, and turn
anxious glances toward his busy comrade, meanwhile
sniffing the atmosphere, and faintly <i>smiling</i>—when
a healthy young man, accustomed to feeding
on first-class chow, day in and day out, is
forced by reason of unusual circumstances to partaking—in
limited quantities at that—of cold
meals, with an extremely minute bill of fare in the
bargain, naturally when once again catching the
appetizing whiff of frying rashers of prime bacon,
also sliced potatoes; and above all the thrilling odor
of boiling Java coffee, how could he help displaying
his joy at the prospect of such a coming treat?</p>

<p class='c011'>The realization was quite as good as the anticipation,
only it must be confessed that when they
had dutifully scraped the pan absolutely clean, and
squeezed out the last drop of the ambrosia Perk
had brewed in some sort of a hobo empty quart
fruit-can, that chanced to be aboard their ship,
neither of them felt filled to capacity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind,” Jack remarked, observing the
rueful expression on his chum’s face, and watching
him rubbing his stomach, as if to show how
far from being distended it was; “the <i>sample</i> was
extra fine. Just hold your horses until we get back
to town, and then the sky is the limit. Get that,
pard?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thanks, awfully, Jack, ole hoss; I’m agoin’ to
live on promises fur a short spell; but oh! baby,
aint the fur bound to fly when I get workin’ my
jaws reg’lar onct again?”</p>

<p class='c011'>After that they lay around and waited, for a
certain length of time must elapse before it would
be safe to start operations.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk asked numerous questions, since as usual
certain matters seemed a bit hazy in his mind,
never as speedy as that of Jack to grasp things.
Despite these breaks the time hung heavily on their
hands, for careful Jack refused to pay any heed
to all the long sighs that welled up from Perk’s
heart, with the object of hastening the decision.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finally, when the impatient one was writhing
as if actually in pain, Jack took compassion on him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I reckon we might just as well make a break,
buddy; once down at the outlet we can do the balance
of our loafing, until it looks safe for us to
start. That ought to be well along toward midnight,
all depending how soon those noisy card
players break up, and hit the hay.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Earlier in the evening there had been considerable
loud talking, calling, and singing among the
confederated fugitives; but already much of this
was stilled. A number of them, however, seemed to
be gathered in the dining hall, gambling—these
evidently were the lucky players; those who had
already turned in the ones who had in previous
bouts been cleaned out, and must hold themselves
in check until another foray had been carried out,
with fresh plunder divided up among the members
of the lawless community.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lying there at the crevice that formed a back
door to their wonderful cave, the two sky detectives
listened, and whispered to each other; meanwhile
keeping a close watch on the big log-cabin,
where lights could be seen through an opening
serving as one of the rude windows, destitute of
glass, and closed in cold weather with wooden
shutters.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When the last game is played out,” Jack was
saying under his breath, for they were not so far
removed from the rough shack in question that
talking in ordinary tones would be exceedingly
risky; “it’s the habit of Simeon as sexton and
cook of the central ranch, to shut up shop, turn
out the lamp and then limp around to the tent
where he sleeps, a pretty tired man I’d say. We
want to be on hand to give him the tip that
strangers are inside the barricades of the valley.
Then, when he knows who’s come to his assistance
we can start to make up our plans for the big
break.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yeou doant kinder guess Simeon he might give
us away in his excitement, eh, partner?” Perk
asked, anxiously, always scenting trouble, it
seemed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not on your life, partner,” Jack assured him.
“Simeon has been in the service for a good many
years, and learned to control his emotions, no
matter what happens. You’ll not hear a whisper
from his lips when we speak his name—I’d stake
anything on that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently, from indications they believed the
last three men had emerged from the dining hall;
some one was moving about within, which Jack
felt certain must be the prisoner who had been
forced to play the part of general servant, possibly
to humiliate him for his attempt to break up the
gang.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s time we moved along,” whispered Jack,
with which remark he crawled out upon the little
ledge, and commenced the rather hazardous task
of backing down the incline, each movement being
executed with extreme care.</p>

<p class='c011'>It turned out just as they had anticipated, for
the sloping ledge kept on to the level of the valley
bed, although it must have been next to impossible
for any one to distinguish its presence from the
level ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack led the way, and they were close to the
tent, when the last light vanished in the big cabin
near by. Presently, just as Jack had figured with
such exactness, a dim figure came slowly around
the corner, almost colliding with the crouching
pair.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch29' class='c015'>CHAPTER XXIX <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>All Ready for the Grand Blowout</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Simeon!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk held his breath in awe as his pal whispered
that one word.</p>

<p class='c011'>An answering voice, very, very low, came back,
asking a question; and in another second Jack
was squeezing the groping hand of the duly thrilled
prisoner of the outlaw’s hidden retreat.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was considered much too risky for them to
remain there, and try to engage in explanations;
so Jack took the other in tow, and led him over to
the foot of the mighty cliff, with Perk trailing
in.</p>

<p class='c011'>So well taken had Jack’s calculations been that
he hit the exact spot at which the descending slope
of rock ended amidst the green grass. In whispers
he explained what must be done in order to gain
a secure place where they might converse without
incurring any risk.</p>

<p class='c011'>With Jack leading the way, and Perk acting as
a buffer in the rear, to prevent the rather unsteady
Simeon, trembling in every limb from extreme excitement,
from falling off the narrow and treacherous
ledge, they all managed to presently gain the
passage leading to the big central cavern.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here they sat down, and a brisk conversation
followed between Jack and Simeon—after Perk
had been duly introduced to the captive Service
man.</p>

<p class='c011'>Without going into too many details everything
was told by Jack, to account for the presence of
himself and partner in the tigers’ den amidst the
mountains. Then in his turn Simeon briefly
sketched the mishap in connection with the discovery
of himself and companion; sadly admitting
that his fellow worker had been shot down and
killed in the battle although combined they had diminished
the roll-call of the tough gangsters by
one bad man slain, and two wounded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was myself seriously shot in the left leg,” he
went on to say; “and undoubtedly would have been
tortured, and put to death by those fiends, they
hate and despise Secret Service men so much, only
for one thing—Slippery Slim Garrabrant chances
to be a brother-in-law of mine—nothing to be
proud of, and of which I’ve never boasted, you
may be certain. We married sisters, both of whom
have since passed on. He has no love for me, but
showed a streak of decency, I must admit, in sparing
my life, although letting the gang make me
its general servant, and cook. Still, things might
have been worse with me, and I’m not complaining.
I reckoned the Chief would do something to learn
just what had become of poor Ross and myself;
but never believed I’d get out of this sweet mess
alive.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They talked, and conspired for a full hour, when
Simeon declared it was time he left these new-found
allies. Some one might happen to come to
his tent on an errand, for he served as doctor as
well as cook; and thus discover his absence.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was arranged that he come again to the crevice
in the cliff the following night, when they could
go deeper into the bold scheme Jack had suggested,
and which appeared to meet with his hearty approval;
for he turned out to be just the same type
of man as Jack Ralston himself, a believer in daring
and aggressive work.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perk managed to explain how short of provisions
they chanced to be, and to his extreme delight
Simeon accommodatingly promised to fetch some
eatables with him when he joined them on the
following night.</p>

<p class='c011'>After that the pair retraced their steps along
the passage, being able, thanks to Jack’s flashlight,
to fight shy of all impediments such as loose stones,
and pitfalls that might have given them a bad half
hour, had they attempted to proceed in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again they tried to get some sleep, and Jack,
who was able to control his feelings better than
his mate, succeeded admirably; but Perk, more
excitable, only secured what he called “cat-naps,”
being awake a good deal of the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following day they spent much as before.
Perk again trailed down to where the camouflaged
airship lay under its covering of evergreens. He
took back a few things they were not apt to need,
and yet which they disliked leaving behind, once
they quitted the neighborhood of the valley; but
his main object was to make certain the plane was
safe, and in condition for a quick take-off in case
such became a necessity, as was likely.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack on his part added materially to his knowledge
of things, and in a fashion touched up portions
of his intended programme, to be carried out
whenever Simeon, who could best know, told them
conditions looked most promising.</p>

<p class='c011'>Much to Perk’s relief Simeon did not fail them;
and then, too, he brought a promising bit of
plunder in the shape of provisions, which came
from the commissary of the settlement, and of
which he held the key.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another hour of talk followed, and further details
of their great plan were discussed. Simeon
assured them the opportunity for which they
waited was certain to arrive on the following night,
so they must make all preparations to put their
confidence to the test and expect to quit the game,
it was to be hoped with a victory set down to
their credit.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the following day a party of the marauders
planned to set out on a most important raid, that
promised unusually great plunder. Slim Garrabrant
could not accompany them that particular
time, having injured his right arm so that he must
be unsteady in the saddle; which fact Jack observed
virtually cinched the plan they had been arranging.</p>

<p class='c011'>If all went well, after the party had gone forth,
Simeon before dark would as if by chance throw
a red cloth on top of the big cabin; which would
be a signal that the coast was clear, and everything
ready for their working scheme.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the following day came along, Perk was
for the third time dispatched along his former
trail down the mountain-side. This time he carried
quite a load on his strong back; for, as they anticipated
not having to spend another night in the
Tom Sawyer cave—Perk always called it by that
suggestive name that carried him back to his own
boyhood dreaming, and reading—he was taking
pretty much all the things he had toted up the
ascent shortly before, so they could be safely
stowed away in the airship’s cabin.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everything thus far had gone along like clockwork—if
only there was no slip after they had
started their attempt to take Slim prisoner, the
chances for a regular old-fashioned cleanup looked
bright, Perk kept telling himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>He got back to Jack’s side in due time, with
nothing transpiring calculated to breed trouble.
They ate their last meal in the cave, and then
passing down to their secret exit, waited for the
time to come when they could translate planning
into action, and endeavor to bring about a successful
windup of their mission.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch30' class='c015'>CHAPTER XXX <br /> <br /><span class='sc'>The End of Robbers’ Roost——Conclusion</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Looking back when all this was but a memory,
it must always seem like a dream to Perk. Everything
moved along smoothly as if in grooves. They
joined the waiting Simeon alongside the big cabin,
and he led them to the hut which Slim occupied
by himself, because of his being the acknowledged
leader and “high-muck-a-muck”—as Perk always
had it—of the outlaw league.</p>

<p class='c011'>They took the occupant completely by surprise,
and a smart blow on the head kept him still until
they could secure his arms, and fasten a cloth
over his mouth to prevent his giving the alarm.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he was hustled outside, and with Jack on
one side and Simeon on the other convoyed as
noiselessly as possible to the mouth of the valley,
and the narrow pass. Perk had vanished for the
time being, but joined them about the time they
reached their objective, acting as though secretly
pleased over something he had just carried out.
Jack had a suspicion as to its character, having
heard the other muttering certain threats that were
aimed at the miserable but useful old ship,
manipulated by the counterfeiters in bringing in supplies,
and distributing the result of their latest
printing.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next thing on the program was to overcome
the sentry just beyond the outer end of the narrow
cleft, where the walls lifted themselves hundreds
of feet above the passage in to the valley.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was accomplished by Jack himself, unaided—he
crept up behind the dozing man, dealt him a
blow on the head, and tumbled him in a heap. Thus
their way was cleared, and they could proceed to
the place where their ship awaited their coming.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gimme me jest five minits, fellers,” Perk besought
the others; whereupon Jack fell upon the
senseless vidette and dragged him some distance
away—it was an act of mercy, since the man
must have been killed otherwise, when Perk completed
his little arrangement; for it had been settled
between Jack and himself that, in order to
convince these tough lawbreakers they could no
longer depend on their Hole-in-the-Wall to hide
them from those who were ever on their trail, the
overhanging walls of the pass must be brought
down in a heap of ruins, that would forever choke
all entrance and exit in and out of the valley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All set, Jack—she’s fixed, an’ goin’ like wildfire—let’s
clear out <i>pronto</i>, ’fore she gets busy!”
Perk was crying, in some little excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>As they moved hurriedly off there came the loud
sound of an explosion from within the cliff encircled
valley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s on’y the little bomb I stuck under that
rattletrap airship to send it in the wust wreck
ever,” explained Perk, he kept looking back while
trailing the others.</p>

<p class='c011'>Loud yells and whoops reached them from
within the barrier. Showing how those of the
gangsters left behind were expressing their astonishment
and alarm at such an unheard of happening in their midst.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh! that ain’t jest <i>nawthin’</i> to what—” but
what Perk intended to say was drowned in a most
terrific explosion, that made the rocky surface of
the earth under their feet quiver like an animal
in its death throes. A vivid sheet of flame darted
upwards—then there came a sickening crash after
crash as if the whole mountain were toppling down,
with fragments falling for half a minute after.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fortunately they were far enough away by that
time to escape any possible damage. Simeon in
particular seemed to be deliriously happy; it was
as though in this utter destruction of the robber
roost he found solace for the death of his late
companion; also all the insults and indignities to
which he himself had been subjected at the hands
of those tough gunmen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Reaching the ship they went aboard. Then
came the last critical act of the moving drama—getting
the big plane safely launched with such
difficulties to contend with. But, as if to add a
finishing touch to Jack Ralston’s usual luck—also
due in great part to his skill, and efficiency—this
hazard was safely passed, the launching followed
by their thrilling climb into the air spaces, with
unlimited possibilities awaiting their choice of a
route.</p>

<p class='c011'>Apparently, as Perk was saying to himself, it
was “all over but the shouting;” and he imagined
there had been quite enough of that when the
startled inmates of the blocked valley heard that
dreadful thunderous sound typifying the collapse
of the organization of defiant lawbreakers clever
Slim Garrabrant had built up, partly to show his
contempt for Uncle Sam’s thief catchers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Slim, by the way, after he had recovered from
the blow received at the time of his surprise, and
capture, exhibited an utter indifference as to what
became of him. He even laughed, as if absolutely
free from any concern; and joked with Perk as
the airship raced through illimitable space, declaring
it was one thing to nab him, and a horse of
another color to hold him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bet you three to one you two boys will have
your same old job to do over again before six
months have gone into the discard,” he shouted,
humorously; but Perk only grinned, and shook
his head; at the same time wondering if the rest
of their lives were really to be taken up with chasing
after this slippery customer, and curbing his
pernicious activities.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having the whole day ahead of them, Jack
did not mean to put his cherished aircraft to its
best licks—plenty of time; and actually he
dreaded receiving the anticipated thanks and compliments
from the Big Boss over at the Washington
Headquarters; in which Jack surely differed
vastly from most men of his dangerous calling,
who would be only too willing to stand in his
shoes.</p>

<p class='c011'>After delivering their prisoner, just as jolly and
unconcerned as ever, over to the Federal officials
at Los Angeles, Jack and Perk headed for San
Diego, the latter wild with an eagerness to “fill
up to capacity” at their beloved restaurant.</p>

<p class='c011'>They carried Simeon along with them, having
a spare cot in their room to which he was more
than welcome, for a day or two, until an answer
came to his wire to Headquarters, ordering him
doubtless to report, and tell his dramatic story in
person, after which he would be given a vacation
to fully recover his broken health.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack had a purpose in this besides the wish to
see more of a man whom he respected so much.
He had heard Simeon say that he and Slim Garrabrant
had married sisters, both of whom were no
longer on this earth. This had set Jack to speculating,
concerning the old lady named Mrs. Ferguson,
grandmother to the handsome little boy
whom he and Perk—principally Perk—had saved
from the cruel fangs of a mad dog, as narrated in
the early pages of this book.</p>

<p class='c011'>He introduced the subject by asking Simeon if
he would like to hear where they had picked up
some kind of a clue covering Slim Garrabrant;
and upon the other eagerly saying he certainly
did, there followed the brief story of the strange
adventure of Main Street, in one of San Diego’s
suburbs.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he spoke of their discovering the picture
of Slim on the wall of that cottage, and incidentally
mentioned the old lady, Simeon was greatly
shaken. He clutched Jack by the arm, Perk staring
open-mouthed, not quite understanding the drift
of things—and in broken language begged him
to tell some more—what about the old lady—did
they know her name—and was it Mrs. Leonore
Ferguson; and what of the lad—was he apparently
in good health?</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m asking you Jack, because he is <i>my own</i>,
my beloved little Walter, the only legacy my dear
wife left me to remember her by, when she passed
away. There was a fire in the building where they
lived, something like a year and a half ago; and
hunt as I would I never could get a trace of my
dear ones. To think that, not content with saving
my own life, you two should be the means of my
being once more reunited with all I have in the
world! Take me to see them without delay, if only
you will, and I shall never, never cease to bless both
you gallant comrades.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Inside of an hour he had his boy pressed close
to his heart, and even Perk who sometimes liked
to call himself a “hard-boiled guy,” turned away
to wipe the unbidden tears from his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course in due time they heard from Headquarters,
with more or less words of high praise,
such as seldom spring from such offices where
Uncle Sam’s Secret Service agents do their business
without expectation of anything more than
routine acknowledgment. They were given quite
an extensive holiday until there came up another
knotty problem which might be submitted to their
solving. That such <i>did</i> come along sooner than expected
can be understood by the title of the story
following this, viz: “<i>Flying the Coast Skyways</i>,”
or, “<i>Jack Ralston’s Swift Patrol</i>.”</p>
